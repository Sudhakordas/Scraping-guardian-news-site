       "  'EU member states have agreed to ration gas this winter, in an attempt to avoid an energy crisis generated by further Russian cuts to supply.Energy ministers from the 27 member states mostly backed a plan for a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter, but added in several opt-outs for island nations and countries unconnected or little connected to the European gas network, which will blunt the overall effect.The European Commission had suggested that a collective 15% gas savings target would reduce gas consumption by 45bn cubic metres. Once exemptions are taken into account the final tally will be lower, after a revolt led by southern European countries that use less or no Russian gas. A senior EU diplomat said the plan would not hit the 45bn cubic metres estimate in the event of a major supply crisis, but still added up to “significant reductions”. The agreement comes less than 24 hours after Russia’s state-controlled energy firm, Gazprom, announced a steep reduction in gas supplies through the critical Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Wednesday. It came only days after Nord Stream 1 went back online at lower capacity, following summer maintenance.EU leaders have accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of attempting to blackmail European countries for supporting Ukraine. Russia has cut or reduced supplies to a dozen EU countries.Welcoming the rationing agreement, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission said: “The announcement by Gazprom that it is further cutting gas deliveries to Europe through Nord Stream 1, for no justifiable technical reason, further illustrates the unreliable nature of Russia as an energy supplier. Thanks to today’s decision, we are now ready to address our energy security at a European scale, as a union.”Jozef Síkela, the Czech minister of industry and trade, who chaired the meeting after days of negotiations over the proposal, hailed the decision as showing that EU member states “will stand tall against any Russian attempt to divide the EU by using energy supplies as a weapon”.“I know the decision was not easy but I think at the end everyone understands that this sacrifice was necessary. We have to and we will share the pain,” he told reporters. He said the decision meant Europe could avoid “dramatic consequences in winter”, including price hikes. But the backing for the energy savings plan was not unanimous. Hungary, which has already secured an opt-out from the EU’s embargo on Russian oil, was alone in voicing its opposition. Unusually for an EU energy ministers’ meeting, Hungary was represented by its foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, who was given an award by Putin last November, only a few months before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Hungary has backed EU sanctions against Russia but has blamed the measures for increasing prices for Hungarian drivers and households, a link strongly rebutted by Brussels.Under the energy savings plan, all EU member states will strive to reduce gas consumption by 15% from August through to the end March. In the event of a total shutdown of Russian gas or high demand, EU states can declare an energy emergency that triggers mandatory savings. Member states rejected an attempt by the European Commission to decide when an energy emergency was under way, which would launch compulsory energy rationing.Countries will be exempt from mandatory cuts if they are island nations unconnected to the EU gas network, such as Ireland and Malta. The Baltic states can also apply for an exemption because their electricity systems are linked to Russia, making them vulnerable to blackouts in the event of a Kremlin-ordered switch-off. The exemption is designed to protect the three former Soviet countries if they are forced to rely on gas to boost electricity supplies.Member states can also ask for an exemption or reduced savings target if they are little connected to the European gas network and can send liquified natural gas to their neighbours, a provision that affects Spain.Spain, with Portugal and Greece, led opposition to the uniform 15% target, arguing it was unfair and failed to take account of their national circumstances.Arriving at the Brussels meeting, Spain’s minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, said no one questioned the need for solidarity but the initial proposal was “not necessarily the most effective approach”. Her rejection of the proposal last week kindled memories of the eurozone crisis, when southern European member states faced strictures from Germany for falling into debt.Turning the eurozone debate on its head, Ribera said Spain had “done our homework” by investing in infrastructure to boost supplies of liquified natural gas, comments that were widely seen as an implicit criticism of Berlin’s decades-long reliance on cheap Russian gas. Critics complained the plans had been designed to help Germany, which has been accused of allowing itself to become dangerously dependent on Russian gas.“Germany made a strategic error in the past with its great dependency on Russian gas and the faith that it would always flow constantly and cheaply,” said Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, who is responsible for energy. “But it is not just a German problem.”France’s minister for energy transition, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, said the health of the whole European economy was at stake: “Our industrial chains are completely interdependent: if the chemical industry in Germany coughs, the whole of European industry could come to a halt.”The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy could soon be teetering on the brink of recession amid evidence that the world’s three biggest economies are all stalling and inflation is higher than previously forecast.In a downbeat update to its April world economic outlook (WEO), the IMF cut its growth forecasts in 2022 and 2023 – and raised the prospect of a more pronounced slowdown.It said problems in the US, China and the eurozone had resulted in global output falling in the second quarter of this year – the first contraction since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The outlook has darkened significantly since April,” said the IMF’s economic counsellor, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. “The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one.” The Washington-based IMF said it now expected the global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2022 – a 0.4-point reduction since April. The slowdown is predicted to continue next year, when growth is now forecast to be 2.9% – 0.7 points lower than had been pencilled in three months ago.The UK is forecast to grow by 3.2% in 2022 and by just 0.5% in 2023 – cuts of 0.5 and 0.7 points. The IMF expects the UK to slow down markedly in the second half of this year and to be the weakest of the G7 economies in 2023.“The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,” Gourinchas said.“Higher than expected inflation, especially in the United States and major European economies, is triggering a tightening of global financial conditions. China’s slowdown has been worse than anticipated amid Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns, and there have been further negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine.”The IMF said that by the fourth quarter of 2022 it was forecasting global inflation of 8.3%, up from its April estimate of 6.9%. It identified the UK – where inflation is now on course to be 2.7 points higher at 10.5% – and the eurozone (up 2.9 points to 7.3%) as places where cost of living pressures had particularly intensified.A breakdown of the revised WEO forecasts showed growth downgrades in 2022 of 0.8 points in the US, 0.9 points in Germany and 1.1 points for China. In 2023, all the world’s major economies apart from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia – both oil exporting countries – are now expected to grow more slowly.Only Japan and Canada of the group of major industrial nations are forecast to grow by more than 1% next year, with the IMF predicting expansion of 1% in the US and France, 0.8% in Germany and 0.7% in Italy.Gourinchas said there were a number of downside risks to the global economy that could result in an even weaker performance. These included:A sudden stop of European gas flows from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine.Stubbornly high inflation.A debt crisis triggered by tighter global financial conditions.Further Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in China.Social unrest triggered by rising food and energy prices.Trade wars and geopolitical fragmentation.“In a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialise, including a full shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, inflation will rise and global growth decelerate further to about 2.6% this year and 2% next year – a pace that growth has fallen below just five times since 1970,” Gourinchas said.“Under this scenario, both the United States and the euro area experience near zero growth next year, with negative knock-on effects for the rest of the world.”The IMF’s economic counsellor said combatting inflation should be the top priority for policymakers, and he supported recent central bank decisions to raise interest rates.“Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship. Central banks that have started tightening should stay the course until inflation is tamed,” he said.Governments could cushion the impact of the slowdown on the most vulnerable through targeted support, Gourinchas said, but the help should be paid for by higher taxes or lower public spending to ensure the job of central banks was not made harder.Unilever, the owner of brands ranging from Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s to Dove soap and Domestos bleach, has raised its prices by 11.2% in recent months and expects to do so again throughout the year.The increase in prices in the three months to the end of June helped the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group report sales growth of 8.1% in the first half of 2022, as the rises compensated for falling volumes of goods sold.Unilever said it expected “material inflation” to remain high for the rest of the year, while the outlook for the global economy and cost inflation was “uncertain and volatile”.However, it said it still expected to improve its profit margins next year and the year after by raising prices, making savings and shifting the mix of product it sold.The group predicts sales growth for the year to be about 6.5%, the top end of expectations, with growth driven by price rises.Alan Jope, the chief executive, said: “Unilever has delivered a first-half performance which builds on our momentum of 2021, despite the challenges of high inflation and slower global growth.“The challenges of inflation persist and the global macroeconomic outlook is uncertain, but we remain intensely focused on operational excellence and delivery in 2022 and beyond.”Prices rose most in home care products such as Persil and Domestos. The amount of food sold dropped by almost 1%, despite sales of takeaway ice-creams such as Magnums rising more than 10%, but the value of sales rose 7.3% as a result of price rises.Unilever said its profit margins had fallen by more than two percentage points after “very high inflation in input costs” that were only partially offset by price rises and cost savings.Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said raising prices had kept Unilever’s sales and profits moving in the right direction and in line with guidance.“Having a host of strong brands is essential if any business wants to pass on rising costs, and Unilever has those up its sleeve – the ability to raise prices just shy of 10% and only have a 1.6% drop in volumes is a good place to be,” he said.Britzman said there was a limit to how much someone would pay for a Magnum, however: “We’ve heard from supermarkets that shoppers are now starting to slide down the value chain in an attempt to keep shopping lists intact.”'),\n",

       "  'Joe Biden has said that his presidential predecessor Donald Trump “lacked the courage to act” as a mob of his supporters tried to halt the congressional certification of his defeat in the 2020 election by mounting the January 6 attack on the Capitol.In virtual remarks Monday to the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, Biden – who was recovering from Covid-19 – said police officers defending the Capitol were “speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized” for hours by white nationalists and other Trump sycophants who bought his false claims that he’d been robbed of victory by electoral fraudsters.“The defeated former president of the United States watched it all happen as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office,” Biden said, alluding to evidence and testimony staged by the congressional committee investigating the assault during a series of public hearings throughout the summer. “While he was doing that, brave law enforcement officers are subjected to the medieval hell for three hours … dripping in blood, surrounded by carnage, face to face with a crazed mob that believed the lies of the defeated president.“The police were heroes that day. Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.”Brave women and men in uniform across America should never forget that the defeated former president of the United States watched January 6th happen and didn’t have the spine to act.In my remarks today to @noblenatl, I made that clear: https://t.co/pQ8E4IcZR1 pic.twitter.com/uO60QO0WrzBiden’s criticism of Trump to the organization known as Noble came four days after the most recent hearing held by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack focused on Trump’s inaction that fateful day.At the hearing, the eighth of its kind this summer, the committee shared testimony from former White House aides that depicted Trump as repeatedly rejecting pleas from his senior advisers and even his own family members to wave off the mob invading the Capitol.The committee said he finally relented after three hours and seven minutes, when he issued a video message telling his supporters, “Go home. We love you. You’re very special.” By then, it had become clear they weren’t able to fully take control of the building, and a late-arriving national guard had come on the scene to reinforce the Capitol police force.A bipartisan Senate report linked at least seven deaths to the riots that day, which unfolded immediately after Trump told his supporters in a speech to “fight like hell”. About 140 police officers were injured as the certification of Biden’s victory over Trump was slowed by several hours.Biden’s words that the former president “lacked the courage to act” echoed past criticism from Trump to his ex-vice-president, Mike Pence.Trump previously tried to pressure Pence into interfering with the certification of Biden’s win in the 2020 race, but he refused, prompting the former president to say: “Mike did not have the courage to act.”It’s unknown for now whether prosecutors intend to build a criminal case against Trump over his actions as well as inaction before the Capitol attack and after it got underway.According to committee members, their evidence is clear that he encouraged his supporters to take desperate measures to block Biden from taking the Oval Office and then stood idly by once they began executing those plans.Biden, in his remarks Monday, said that proved Trump isn’t the law-and-order politician that he long touted himself as.“You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-cop,” Biden said. “You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy. You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-American.”Firefighters battling an explosive blaze near Yosemite national park significantly slowed the spread of the flames, but thousands of residents from mountain communities remained under evacuation, while smoke drifted to reach Lake Tahoe, parts of Nevada and the San Francisco Bay Area.More than 2,500 firefighters with aircraft support were battling the blaze, known as the Oak fire, that erupted last Friday near the town of Midpines, California. Officials described “explosive fire behavior” on Saturday as flames made runs through bone-dry vegetation caused by the worst drought in decades.By Tuesday morning, the blaze had consumed more than 18,000 acres of forest land, with 26% containment, the California department of forestry and fire protection, or Cal Fire, said. At least 55 homes and structures had been burned.“Persistent drought, critically dry fuels and tree mortality continue to contribute to the fire’s spread,” Cal Fire said on Tuesday morning, but humidity levels were slightly higher, aiding crews in their fire fight.On Monday, helicopters had dropped 300,000 gallons of water on the fire, the agency said.Evacuations were in place on Monday for over 6,000 people living across a several-mile span of the sparsely populated fire zone in the Sierra Nevada foothills, though a handful of residents defied the orders and stayed behind, said Adrienne Freeman, a US Forest Service spokesperson.“We urge people to evacuate when told,” she said.The cause of the fire remained under investigation.On Monday, smoke from the fire shrouded Yosemite national park’s vistas in a thick grey haze, as the air quality index (AQI) pushed past 250, a level categorised as very unhealthy. Smoke also produced poor visibility to the north of the fire during the day and across the fire at night, Cal Fire said.Smoke drifted more than 200 miles (322km) to reach part of northern California and Nevada.There are two major blazes burning in California, which is experiencing a fairly typical ramp-up to what is sure to be an active fire year once California’s infamous Santa Ana and Diablo wind events begin in September, said Kim Zagaris, an adviser with the Western Fire Chiefs Association, which maps wildfires across the country.“We’ve been fortunate. We’re not quite as far along as we were at this time last year,” he said. “But the fuels, the vegetation, are much dryer than they were last year. It’s so dry out there.”Zagaris compared the wildfires in California this year to 2008, when few blazes burned early but a mid-summer barrage of lightning hit the state “and before we knew it there were 2,000 fires burning in the northern part of the state”.California has experienced increasingly larger and deadlier wildfires in recent years as climate change has made the west much warmer and drier over the past 30 years. Scientists have said weather will continue to be more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable.Numerous roads were closed, including a stretch of state route 140 that is one of the main routes into Yosemite. The utility Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) said on its website that more than 2,600 homes and businesses in the area had lost power as of Monday and there was no indication when it would be restored.The Oak fire was sparked as firefighters made progress against an earlier blaze, the Washburn fire, that burned to the edge of a grove of giant sequoias in the southernmost part of Yosemite national park.The latter fire, spanning a 7.5-sq-mile (19-sq-km) area, was 87% contained on Monday after burning for two weeks and moving into the Sierra national forest.A German-Iranian political scientist – the victim of a kidnapping by the Iranian secret service – has mounted a last ditch defence against multiple charges of terrorism in a Tehran court.Jamshid Sharmahd is expected to be sentenced later, possibly to death, after a government appointed lawyer has given his defence. His own lawyers have not been allowed to represent him, but Sharmahd insisted he was not guilty.The German embassy had asked to attend the final day of the six-day trial – on Tuesday – but was denied access.Sharmahhd’s daughter Gazelle said: “It should horrify every citizen who cares about human rights that a regime is breaking international law to kidnap foreign journalists, torture them and silence them through progressive and shameless lies in a medieval show trial of state assassination. They have sabotaged his right to a fair trial. They are breaking their own constitution.”She claimed her father, a US resident and German citizen, had been kept incommunicado for two years and can barely walk. In pictures of him in court on Tuesday he appeared a broken man. She said: “Myself and my mother feel physically nauseated and unable to sleep with the worry. The nausea keeps building.”She said her father had only been allowed to speak to his wife this year twice in heavily supervised calls, something Gazelle described as a form of torture in itself. The couple have been married for 40 years.An online petition has gathered more than 75,000 signatures calling on the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, to intervene.Sharmahd had been living in California since 2003 where he had set up a website that curated dissident news and opinions from Iranians inside the country. Gazelle said her father’s articles were critical of the Iranian regime, but she insists he never advocated or directed terrorism.Sharmahd’s family say he was captured aged 67 by the Iranians when he had to make a three-day stop-over at Dubai airport on a trip from Germany to India about 28 July 2020.They claim he was also previously the victim of assassination attempts in California.Tehran by contrast claims he played a role in a 2008 terrorist attack on a mosque in Shiraz that left 14 dead, and more than 100 wounded.The final court hearing heard claims that he had been responsible for more than the 2008 attack, and had been directing terrorist activities from afar, attacks that had been foiled more than 30 times by the intelligence services.Some observers claim there has been a notable rise in the numbers of foreign nationals being captured or prosecuted as the talks on the future of the Iran nuclear deal remain frozen. At the same time the number of Iranians being arrested has also risen. The arrests have followed the appointment of General Mohammad Kazemi, to head the IRGC intelligence organisation. He formerly headed the IRGC’s counterintelligence unit.Sharmahd’s family said they were told his defence lawyer, a government appointed attorney, had been duty bound to reference a 10-page confession he allegedly signed while under torture, so the prospect of his release is minimal.Iranian news agencies claimed in their report that he had denied some charges, but implied he regretted some attacks. The absence of independent reporters in the court makes it impossible to judge precisely what happened in court.Three people have been arrested after the death of a 21-year-old British man killed by a spinning rotor blade when he disembarked in Athens from a helicopter chartered by his family from Mykonos.Greek authorities said the aircraft’s pilot and two ground engineers were detained after the incident. “Our inquiry has focused on possible negligence,” a police source said. “Basic questions have emerged from witness testimony as to why the blades were not at a standstill when passengers were allowed to disembark on Monday.”The victim, identified as Jack Fenton, was killed instantly. He was due to return to the UK on a private jet after holidaying with his parents on Mykonos.Greek media said the Oxford Brookes student was struck by the helicopter’s rear rotor while attempting to take a selfie within seconds of the Bell 407 touching down at a helipad near Spata.Fenton’s parents, who were flying behind in a second helicopter, were reportedly unaware of the tragedy when their own pilot was alerted and they were diverted to Athens international airport.A fleet of waiting limousines had been due to take the group to the airport from the helipad.The Mykonos-Athens passage has become a popular route for Superior Air, the aviation company that operated the luxury helicopter.Mykonos, which has attracted the likes of Elon Musk this summer, has become a magnet for the super-rich. The results of an official police inquiry are expected to be delivered to a public prosecutor on Tuesday. “We have interviewed witnesses including the [three] friends who were travelling with him,” an officer said. “The probe will then be sent to the prosecutor who will assume the case.”The unnamed pilot could face charges of involuntary manslaughter, according to media reports.Superior Air was quoted as saying that safety protocols had been followed when the helicopter landed in Athens.The Greek newspaper Protothema said landing staff had guided the passengers from the aircraft but Fenton, the first to disembark unexpectedly turned back and walked towards the helicopter as its engines were still in motion.From covidé (infected with coronavirus) to confinement (lockdown) and éco-anxiété (climate anxiety) to verdissement d’image (greenwashing), the pandemic and the climate crisis account for most new French words, Le Monde has concluded.But if 28% of recent additions are essentially English, according to an analysis by the paper, nearly half are French coinages, demonstrating what it called the language’s “great suppleness, as well as the creativity and humour of its users”.Le Monde studied the 514 words incorporated in the authoritative Le Robert and Larousse dictionaries over the past three years, finding the number of new medical terms had trebled to represent about 20% of all new entries.“I had never seen one typology of words so overrepresented among our new lexical entries,” said Carine Girac-Marinier, the head of Larousse’s dictionary department. “Quite suddenly, a very specialist vocabulary was being adopted by everyone.”As well as technical terms (asymptomatique, PCR), existing words were adapted – as in vaccinodrome, for vaccination centre, and confinement, with its logical corollary déconfinement, the end of lockdown. Whole new expressions, such as cas contact (when you’ve been in close contact with someone who is covidé) also emerged.While social issues (including the inevitable wokisme) accounted for a slightly higher proportion of new words overall, the climate crisis and its impact on human activity provided the most neologisms and extensions of meaning, Le Monde found.These ranged from plasticroûte (a blue crust of plastic formed on coastal rocks) to écoblanchissement (an alternative to verdissement for greenwashing), surcyclage (upcycling) and – much used in France in recent weeks – mégafeux.Of words imported into French from foreign languages, English accounted for the vast majority – about 80%, Le Monde found. The French generally avoided English pandemic terms, preferring gestes barrières, for example, to social distancing.But English borrowings were very common in the technical and social fields, said Géraldine Moinard, the publishing director of Le Robert. “English is everywhere,” she told Le Monde. “It’s unavoidable, a kind of model.”Not all borrowings were the same, however, the paper noted. “Some are just lifted straight: coffee shop, fan art, mocktail, vibe,” it said. “Others, such as hipstérisation and instagrammeur/euse are English words that have been ‘francicised’.”Yet others combine an English inspiration with a recognised French term: cododo, for example, uses the French dodo (“by-byes” or “beddy-bye”) to translate the English term co-sleeping, while sexto adapts texto (text message) to convey sexting.“No one should be offended,” Girac-Marinier told the paper. “Lots of English originally came from medieval French. Exchanging words is all part of the dynamism of language.”Other languages from which French has borrowed in recent years include Japanese, Korean (mainly for culinary terms), Danish and Swedish (for hygge and lagom respectively).But French, the experts say, is more than holding its own.Fully 43.6% of new definitions are French coinages or extensions, Le Monde calculated, including vingtenaire (someone in their 20s), consommacteur (conscious consumer) – and the perhaps not-very-French coolitude, defined as “a state of relaxation and calm, often conducive to tolerant behaviour”.When Russian tanks rolled into the Ukrainian city of Kherson, Olha fled with her children and pet cat, Venera. The family travelled across the Polish border, through Germany and Sweden, before arriving in London. Now she faces yet another challenge: bureaucracy.‘I feel bewildered by the inefficiency of the authorities’When we escaped the war, we were dreaming of somewhere where we wouldn’t hear the bombs or live in fear of being killed by Russians. So, on one hand, we have achieved our goal and should be happy, but it is not always that easy or simple.First, we lived for weeks under Russian occupation. Then we travelled through Europe as we waited for a British visa. Now we are faced with the overwhelming challenge of getting set up in Britain, which has left me conflicted.‘I burst into tears in the hostel corridor’When we arrived in Brussels to travel on the Eurostar to London, we were told: “Sorry, cats are not allowed.” They don’t let any animals on the train, not even a goldfish. We were told to go to Holland or France and to get on a ferry or bus instead. I tried calling the ferry company time and time again but no one ever answered.In Calais, everywhere was closed but a woman I met in the street said she would introduce me to another Ukrainian woman, who had also applied for a pet passport. She was staying at a hostel and, amazingly, when we got there I saw it was my friend Alina. We knew each other when I worked in the Kyiv region and our daughters even went to the same school.“You need a European passport, with stars, for a cat,” she told me. “Otherwise they won’t let you on the ferry.” Once I applied nobody was able to tell me how long the wait would be. Maybe tomorrow, maybe five days, no one knew. The uncertainty over if and when we could actually go to London knocked me completely. I burst into tears in the corridor of the hostel.A vet suggested blood tests on the cat to test for antibodies and expedite obtaining the cat “visa”. They offered this service free of charge but Venera is not a simple cat. After many attempts and a lot of scratches, they said she would have to be sedated.After that visit, I cried all day as Venera eventually dozed peacefully in her carrier.After many calls and emails to the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), we finally got the licence and with it the go-ahead to travel to Britain.‘My children are very lonely’One of the first questions I asked the local council was about the school. My children haven’t been able to study since the war began on 24 February. I imagined that my kids would go to school immediately after arrival as there were more than two months left until the end of the school year. But no. I was sent a page with a list of schools, but it’s not easy to choose from the list of something you know nothing about.After waiting for replies, we began visiting schools in our neighbourhood but were turned away. I asked the council for help several times. Getting my kids into school is the main priority right now. Some schools suggest waiting until September to see if they have places but my children are very lonely, they can’t speak with peers, they can’t integrate.Finally, my daughter received a letter. It was a card with a clear inscription in capital letters: “Work permitted.” Has the world gone mad? After five weeks of waiting, a 12-year-old received not a school admission but a work permit.The school situation has a knock-on effect on my ability to find work too. The jobcentre staff know my kids are not at school until September and I am unable to work until then. I’ve got three diplomas in different specialities and the jobcentre staff have told me to apply for cleaning jobs or shelf stacking at Tesco.‘The world is just grey’It would seem that the system should work according to an algorithm – in order to get A, you need to do B, and in extreme cases C. Psychologically, it would be easier if there were at least a warning about hitches and some kind of timeframe. Instead of the supposed “a couple of days”, the expectation becomes “week after week” without a definite end point.If I had come to London a year ago, I would have been mesmerised by its beauty and architecture but now I feel nothing. The world is just grey. Every morning is a struggle to get out of bed. Then I remember I have so much to do for my children. Constant forms, writing emails, attending appointments. If I have a free day, I try to find Ukrainian books (I visit the library but there are none in my language) or access the local gym, which is free for Ukrainian refugees.I worry I won’t see my parents again. The worst days were when the Russians cut off communication for people in Kherson and I couldn’t speak to my family. But now the internet is restored, we can talk. I send pictures of their grandchildren. In return, they send me a photo of a burnt-out car outside their house. It was shot at with people inside it for breaking a curfew.I am becoming more and more frustrated with forced idleness. It is impossible to find comfort when your friends and family are on frontlines and occupied. I feel the overwhelming desire to do something useful and help Ukraine even from here. I take part in different demonstrations, helping with translation and collecting money for the war effort. It’s volunteer work so I don’t get paid, but until I’m able to work it is all I can do to help my people.Worries over insurance are the biggest obstacle to grain ships leaving Ukraine’s Black Sea ports this week, exporters say.Questions remain over whether insurance companies will be willing to insure the vessels as they navigate the mined waters, while buyers are hesitant to make new orders given the risk of Russian attacks.Russian missiles struck the main port of Odesa on Saturday, just 12 hours after Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, signed an agreement in Istanbul guaranteeing safe passage for Ukraine’s exports. Russia later said it had targeted a Ukrainian vessel at the port carrying western weapons, but did not present evidence. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said on Monday that the first ships would leave their Black Sea ports this week, despite the attacks. Kubrakov, who signed on behalf of Kyiv, said that although Ukraine did not trust Russia, “it trusts its allies and partners, which is why the agreement … was signed with the UN and Turkey and not Russia”.A spokesperson from the ministry said it was working to implement the plans as early as this Friday or early next week.But the markets are sceptical. They are waiting to see what happens before putting in new orders, according to Masha Belikova, an agriculture expert at the commodity price reporting agency Fastmarkets.“[Exporters] have been very pessimistic and are still very pessimistic about the agreement,” said Belikova. “First, and most importantly, is that [they] can’t trust Russia, so any agreement with Russia is not really seen as an agreement.”The general priority of exporters and buyers, said Belikova, is to move the grain that is loaded on vessels that have been sitting in Ukraine’s ports since the invasion. If everything goes smoothly, said Belikova, they will then start thinking about moving what is stored at the ports. “Maybe, then, if everything goes OK, they might think about new trades,” said Belikova, referring to new orders. “For now, they don’t think it is possible.”Ukraine is one of the world’s biggest exporters of wheat, corn and sunflower oil. Russia’s invasion and its naval blockade of Ukraine’s ports have driven up global food prices, pushing some countries, such as Somalia, towards famine.One of the big issues being raised by the industry is who will insure such a risky journey.“It’s really hard to guarantee any safety for the crew, for the cargos, for the people that are working at the port,” said Belikova. “What if they decide that there is some military object – just close the terminal?”There is talk that Turkish commercial ships may be used for future exports as the rest of the world’s ships may be more reticent of the dangers, said Tim Worledge, also of Fastmarkets.However, Turkish ships tend to be smaller, carrying just 10,000-15,000 tons, whereas the type of ships that previously operated from Ukraine tended to carry 40,000-70,000 tons of cargo, said Worledge.For the last five months, Ukraine has been using the shallow-water ports along the Danube, which borders Ukraine and Romania, and Ukrainian rail has been working to increase rail exports into Europe.Ukraine now exports up to about 2m tons of grain and meal a month through these channels, said Belikova. Before the war, the total was between 6m and 8m tons a month.Russia’s invasion and approach to negotiations, including its attack last Saturday, has caused buyers to think about diversifying their supplies, said Worledge.Ukraine’s infrastructure minister said the exports would start from Chornomorsk port, the closest port to Ukraine’s Romanian border. Belikova said that, according to shipping data, there were at least 10 vessels that had been stuck in the port since 24 February, which amounts to more than 600,000 tons.The Kremlin has insisted its decision to shut down the agency that processes Jewish migration to Israel should not be “politicised”, amid a widening rift between the two countries over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.Last week Russia’s justice ministry requested the liquidation of the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency, a private charity closely affiliated with the Israeli government that promotes migration to Israel.The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that the ministry’s request came after the organisation, which has several offices in cities across the country, violated Russian laws.“There are issues from the point of view of complying with Russian law,” Peskov said. “The situation should not be politicised or projected on to the entirety of Russian-Israeli relations.”While Israel is one of the few western nations not to have imposed sanctions on Russia, and has abstained from selling weapons to Ukraine, senior Israeli officials have grown more vocal in their condemnation of Russia’s war.In April the then foreign minister, Yair Lapid, accused Moscow of war crimes after reports emerged of the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian towns of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel.Last month the family of Pinchas Goldschmidt, Moscow’s longtime rabbi, announced that Goldschmidt left for Israel weeks after the invasion of Ukraine after resisting Kremlin pressure to support the war.Relations between the two countries also took a hit in May when Russia’s longtime foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood” and that the “most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews”. Israel has called these comments “unforgivable”.Lapid, who is now Israel’s caretaker prime minister, said on Sunday that the closing of the Jewish Agency would be “grave, with ramifications for [bilateral] relations”.Amid the diplomatic spat, Israel announced on Tuesday its plans to expand humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, which for the first time will include financial support for civil aid organisations in the war-battered country, the Times of Israel reported.Meanwhile, Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, criticised Israel’s “completely unconstructive and, most importantly, biased” stance over Ukraine. “It has been completely incomprehensible and strange to us,” she told Russian state television on Tuesday.Tens of thousands of Russians, many highly educated and skilled, have left the country since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine more than five months ago. About 16,000 people have arrived in Israel from Russia since the start of the war, according to the Jewish Agency.Israel’s immigration minister, Pnina Tamano-Shata, told local television that 600,000 Russians were currently eligible to move to Israel.Kremlin critics have linked the pressure on the Jewish Agency to the growing crackdown on civil society since the start of the campaign in Ukraine. Dozens of foreign-funded organisations and charities have been shut down.According to the Jerusalem Post, several foreign-funded Jewish organisations operating in Russia received warning letters from the Russian government last week.A British citizen who video blogs pro-Kremlin material from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine has been added to a UK government sanctions list.Graham Phillips, who has been accused of being a conduit for pro-Russian propaganda, is one of 42 new designations added to the UK’s Russia sanctions list. Other additions include Russia’s minister and deputy minister of justice and two nephews of the Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who was himself placed under sanctions by Britain in March.Phillips – the first UK citizen to be added to the growing sanctions list – has long been a controversial figure, receiving medals from the Russian state for his reporting. He has consistently toed the Russian line on the war, suggesting in recent weeks that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that the massacre of Ukrainians in Bucha was staged.In April Phillips drew condemnation from Boris Johnson and others when he interviewed Aiden Aslin, a British member of the Ukrainian armed forces who had been captured by Russian forces during the siege of Mariupol. Aslin is facing the death penalty.The new UK sanctions list includes Syrian officials accused of recruiting mercenaries to fight in Ukraine, as well as Vitaliy Khotsenko, the Russian-imposed prime minister of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, and Vladislav Kuznetsov, the first deputy chairman of the self-proclaimed republic in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine.Sarvar and Sanjar Ismailov, the nephews of Alisher Usmanov, have significant interests in the UK and are believed to own homes in Highgate and Hampstead Heath in London.Phillips – who faces a freeze of his assets – is described on the sanctions list as “a video blogger who has produced and published media content that supports and promotes actions and policies which destabilise Ukraine and undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine”.Commenting on the newly sanctioned individuals, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “We will not keep quiet and watch Kremlin-appointed state actors suppress the people of Ukraine or the freedoms of their own people. We will continue to impose harsh sanctions on those who are trying to legitimise Putin’s illegal invasion until Ukraine prevails.”Johnson described Phillips’ interview with Aslin as a “propaganda message” for Russia. Aslin’s local MP, Robert Jenrick, said Phillips’ video showed his constituent “handcuffed, physically injured and being interviewed under duress for propaganda purposes”.Jenrick said the video was a breach of the Geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war and that “the interviewer Graham Phillips is in danger of prosecution for war crimes”.Aslin was captured by Russian forces while defending the besieged city of Mariupol, although it remains unclear how he ended up being interviewed by Phillips.Phillips says his work is self-funded and regularly solicits donations from his 264,000 YouTube subscribers. He also earns money from YouTube adverts paid for by big western companies. YouTube has so far declined to take down Phillips’ videos, despite calls from politicians to remove the channel.In July 2014 he was banned from entering Ukraine but managed to illegally enter the occupied territories.His rise from obscure Briton abroad to figure of national political interest was unlikely. According to a 2014 interview with BuzzFeed News, Phillips first went to Ukraine when travelling as an away fan to an England football match.Aged 30, he quit his job at the now defunct UK government Central Office of Information and moved full-time to Ukraine, where he reinvented himself as a journalist.On Monday night at 8pm, the familiar, defiant sound of clashing pots and pans returned to the streets of Yangon. In the aftermath of last year’s coup, the same din was heard nightly as people demanded the return of democracy – until the military launched brutal crackdowns against any such acts of dissent. Anyone suspected of opposing the junta risks arrest, or worse.It was the recent execution of four prisoners that drove people to revive the protest regardless. Phyo Zeya Thaw, a rapper and former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, and the prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, known as Jimmy, were among those killed. They had been sentenced under anti-terror laws in January.The Guardian spoke to anti-junta figures in Myanmar and in exile abroad about their executions, which provoked condemnation from across the world, and horror within Myanmar.The people of Myanmar are already well aware of the junta’s brutality, said Salai Za Uk Ling, deputy executive director of the Chin Human Rights Organization, which has documented atrocities, including the burning of homes and massacre of civilians, since the coup. Yet the brazenness of the executions was shocking, he added. “In such a public display of brutality, I don’t know what justification they would give,” he said, adding that it illustrated how the junta did not seem to care about its international reputation.Thet Swe Win, a 36-year-old human rights activist and an executive director of Synergy, an organisation which strives to foster social harmony in Myanmar, said he feared that there may now be a spate of executions. Dozens more prisoners have been sentenced to death.“This is similar to the first bullet that they shot at Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing,” he said, referring to the first protester killed by the military after the coup last year. “Then they killed many protesters during the crackdown.”More than 2,100 people have been killed by the junta and 11,759 remain in detention, according to the advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) Burma, which monitors arrests and killings.Ei Ei Moe, 33, is a member of Generation Wave, a movement co-founded by Phyo Zeya Thaw, whom she knew personally. She said he had always wanted the people to stay united.“I wasn’t even able to cry when I heard about the execution, I had suffocation in my heart. I didn’t know what to do. I still think that he is still with us. As long as the social media has the photos of him, it was more unbelievable to me,” she said. Phyo Zeya Thaw was among a first generation of rappers in Myanmar whose music – and coded criticisms of the previous military regime – chimed with young listeners. He later became an MP.Observers say the executions are a further attempt to crush opposition that has remained defiant even in the face of crackdowns that the UN rights office has said may amount to war crimes.Activists say they are undeterred, however. “This generation won’t be scared. If they killed one Zeya Thaw, there will be countless numbers of Zeya Thaw,” said Ei Ei Moe.Activist Ella Chris described Kyaw Min Yu, who rose to prominence as a student leader during the 1988 uprising against the previous military regime, as “an idol for the younger pro-democracy generation”. Before the coup, Ella Chris was an avid cyclist posting fitness videos on social media in between her work on gender equality and land rights. Like many involved in anti-coup protests, she was forced to flee her home. “But we are not afraid,” she said.Myanmar’s military junta, which seized power in a coup in February 2021, has struggled to maintain control of the country. It faces both peaceful protest movements and a resistance backed by several armed ethnic groups.Some of these powerful ethnic groups condemned the executions, among them the Arakan Army and a representative of the Kachin Independence Army, which both called the killings a “foolish” act that damaged the prospect of negotiations. In eastern Myanmar, the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force vowed to retaliate against the “war crime”.A Yangon-based group of resistance fighters under the national unity government, which was formed in exile by elected politicians, ethnic minority representatives and activists, also vowed to avenge their deaths. On Monday, guerrilla fighters in Yangon and Mandalay launched attacks at junta targets, while a flash protest in Yangon displayed a poster reading “we are never scared” before quickly dispersing to avoid arrest.While many have been driven to join armed resistance groups that use whatever weapons they can source to fight against the junta, others continue to find ways to hold peaceful demonstrations.In urban areas, these are flash mobs that last just a few minutes but which must be impeccably planned months in advance, with preparations made for the possibility of someone being detained, said Thinzar Shunlei Yi, a prominent anti-coup activist. “Do we have enough safe houses to relocate, do we have enough information to shut down our Facebook accounts and immediately cut all communication? Because once one person gets arrested then every one of us has to relocate.”Activists continue even though they know they risking their lives, she added. “Not just our own lives, but it could also cost our own families’ lives, our friends’ lives,” she said. Even a critical comment on Facebook is risky.Sut Seng Htoi, an activist in Kachin, northern Myanmar, questioned the international response given that the junta declared it would carry out the executions.“I wonder why they didn’t take any action,” she said. “It’s made me even more distrustful of the international community and UN,” echoing the feelings of many who feel the international community has failed Myanmar.Thet Swe Win, said the international community “must take tangible actions rather than issuing statements on wasted paper”. He added: “We don’t forget and we don’t forgive. We will keep fighting, even if no one helps us.”Yosemite national park’s dramatic vistas were shrouded by a thick grey haze on Monday afternoon, as smoke from the fiercely burning Oak fire hung over its granite peaks. Along the road winding toward the valley, skeletal trees told the story of the Washburn fire that tore through just weeks earlier.The blazes – the two largest to ignite in California so far this year – have besieged Yosemite during one of its busiest months, causing entrance closures, cancellations, and cloaking the landmark in hazardous air.But many visitors, some of whom have travelled to see the sights from across the US and around the world, were determined not to let the conditions slow them down. On Monday afternoon, as the air quality index (AQI) pushed past 250, a level categorised as very unhealthy, cars zigzagged through the park carrying bikes and inner tubes, ready for the day.Under a fiery-orange glow, visitors could be seen picnicking, trekking, and floating in the river despite the strong scorched scent that filled the air as ash danced in the breeze. Tents still lined campgrounds throughout the valley, bikes crisscrossed through the paths alongside emergency vehicles, and people piled on to the shuttle.Mark and Victoria, aged 12 and seven, who had travelled all the way from Finland, managed to get one swim in the river before calling it a day because of the declining air quality. “We have still had a great day today – better than expected,” their father, Rami Madanad, said as he watched them from the shore alongside his wife, Marina. They had only planned for one day in the park and were trying to make the most of it, but everyone’s eyes had begun to burn.Others, however, were wavering on whether they would brave the harsh conditions. Darren Stehle brought his family down from Oregon. They had already had to cancel plans to go to one national park this year due to natural disaster, when Yellowstone was hit by record-breaking floods. “And then we decided to do this,” he said, shaking his head and laughing as he peered out over Tunnel View vantage point, now completely clouded in smoke.“If the kids want to get out we will get out – even though we have a reservation for two nights,” Mike Dyangko, who was there with Stehle, said of his grandchildren. “It’s not worth them getting sick.”Yosemite, which typically has more than half a million visitors each July, has been hammered by fire this month. National Park Service (NPS) officials and hospitality representatives with Aramark, the company that handles the park’s reservations, recreation and restaurants, say they closely monitor hazards and work with local health officials to determine if closures are essential. But often the park remains open even when risks are present.“For a lot of folks this is their visit,” said the Yosemite spokesperson Scott Gediman, noting that the NPS does what it can to keep the park open. “The health and safety of the firefighters and visitors is our paramount concern,” he added. But, with air quality fluctuating throughout the day, he said Yosemite provided information and options to guests and expected them to make up their own minds using good judgment. The park would not close, he said, “unless the air quality becomes consistently dangerous for everybody”.The park does offer more leniency with cancellations as the air quality deteriorates and enables more sensitive groups to opt out without penalty. Facilitated outdoor activities, such as bike rentals and pool access, also shut down when AQI spikes above 150 – a level considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Clean air stations are open for staff around the clock and officials said decisions are adapted as conditions change.“Fires, floods, rock-falls – these are natural processes, and that’s what a national park is all about,” Gediman said. But officials still do all they can to mitigate disasters, and these fires are being attacked for full suppression. “National parks like Yosemite are wild by nature,” he added. “People understand that and people are for the most part making good decisions.”In recent years, however, these hard decisions have had to be made more often. Fuelled by the climate crisis, disasters are on the rise. Fires are burning more ferociously, especially in parched, overgrown landscapes across California’s Sierra Nevada. The constant threat of catastrophe – or even just uncomfortable conditions – is enough to drive some to give up on the park.“There’s so much fire damage,” Aaron Ford said, leaning on his car loaded up with bikes. “We’d never been to Yosemite so our plan was to just get out and hike around,” his wife, Kim, added. “But now we are planning to skip the hiking.”The Ford family, who were visiting from Malibu, California, do not plan on trying again soon. Even after reserving passes, they decided to cruise through quickly, heading to the clearer skies in Mammoth farther east.“It’s hard because it feels like there’s a fire here every year,” Kim said. “If you want to book anything you have to book a year in advance,” she added. “The chances are high that there’s going to be something like this.”The temperatures in Portland, Oregon, could top 100F (37.8C) on Tuesday, making it probably the hottest day of a week-long heatwave for the Pacific north-west region that rarely sees such scorching weather.Forecasters issued an excessive heat warning for parts of Oregon and Washington state. Temperatures could hit the 90s (32C) in Seattle and 110F (43.3C) in eastern parts of Oregon and Washington.While interior parts of the states often experience high temperatures, those kind of hot blasts do not happen nearly as often in Portland and Seattle.“To have five-day stretches or a week-long stretch above 90 degrees is very, very rare for the Pacific north-west,” said Vivek Shandas, professor of climate adaptation at Portland State University.As the north-western US heated up, the hot spell on the east coast appeared to have broken, with few areas east of the Mississippi River under heat advisories. Philadelphia hit 99F on Sunday before factoring in humidity. Newark, New Jersey, had its fifth consecutive day of 100F or higher, the longest such streak since records began in 1931. Boston also hit 100F, surpassing the previous daily record high of 98F (36.6C) set in 1933. Tuesday’s forecast highs in Philadelphia, New York and Boston were all in the mid-80s.Residents and officials in the north-west have been trying to adjust to the likely reality of longer, hotter heatwaves following last summer’s deadly “heat dome” weather phenomenon that prompted record temperatures and deaths.In response, the Portland housing bureau, which oversees city housing policy, will require newly constructed subsidized housing to have air conditioning in the future.A new Oregon law will require all new housing built after April 2024 to have air conditioning installed in at least one room. The law already prohibits landlords in most cases from restricting tenants from installing cooling devices in their rental units.The measures were in response to the heatwave in late June and early July 2021, when about 800 people died in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. The temperature soared to 116F (46.7C) in Portland and smashed heat records in cities and towns across the region. Many of those who died were elderly and lived alone.While temperatures this week are not expected to get that high, the anticipated number of consecutive hot days raised concerns among officials.Portland, Oregon, could top 100F on Tuesday and temperatures across wide swaths of western Oregon and Washington are predicted to be well above historic averages throughout the week.“It’s nothing we haven’t seen before in terms of the magnitude, but the duration of the event is fairly unusual,” said John Bumgardner, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Portland.Portland’s bureau of emergency management is opening cooling centers in public buildings and installing misting stations in parks. In Seattle, community centers and libraries will serve as cooling stations.Multnomah county, which includes Portland, will open four overnight emergency cooling shelters starting on Tuesday where people can spend the night.Officials hope the outreach efforts will help people facing the greatest heat risks – including older people, those living alone, people with disabilities, members of low-income households without air conditioning and people without housing.Jenny Carver, Multnomah county’s emergency manager for the department of county human services, said her work had focused on “ensuring that these sites are as low-barrier as we can make them”.“We ask folks to just give a name and we don’t check any identification,” said Carver. “We make as many resources available as we can.”Overnight temperatures in the Pacific north-west may not go below the 70s, said Treena Jenson, the Portland warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service.“In the urban areas we have the urban heat island effect that tends to keep temperatures warmer a little bit longer and can cause more heat impacts,” she said. A melting glacier in the Alps has shifted the border between Switzerland and Italy, putting the location of an Italian mountain lodge in dispute.The borderline runs along a drainage divide – the point at which meltwater will run down either side of the mountain towards one country or the other.But the Theodul Glacier’s retreat means the watershed has crept towards the Rifugio Guide del Cervino, a refuge for visitors near the 3,480-metre (11,417ft) Testa Grigia peak – and it is gradually sweeping underneath the building.On a recent visit to the refuge’s restaurant, Frederic, a 59-year-old tourist, asked: “So – are we in Switzerland?”It was a question worth asking. The answer has been the subject of diplomatic negotiations that started in 2018 and concluded with a compromise last year, but the details remain secret.When the refuge was built on a rocky outcrop in 1984, its 40 beds and long wooden tables were entirely in Italian territory. But now two-thirds of the lodge, including most of the beds and the restaurant, is technically perched in southern Switzerland.The issue has come to the fore because the area, which relies on tourism, is located at the top of one of the world’s largest ski resorts, with a major new development including a cable car station being constructed a few metres away.An agreement was hammered out in Florence in November 2021 but the outcome will only be revealed once it is rubber-stamped by the Swiss government, which will not happen before 2023.“We agreed to split the difference,” said Alain Wicht, the chief border official at Switzerland’s national mapping agency Swisstopo.His job includes looking after the 7,000 boundary markers along landlocked Switzerland’s 1,200-mile (1,935km) border with Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Liechtenstein.Wicht attended the negotiations, where both parties made concessions to find a solution. “Even if neither side came out winners, at least nobody lost”, he said.Where the Italian-Swiss border traverses Alpine glaciers, the frontier follows the watershed line. But the Theodul Glacier lost almost a quarter of its mass between 1973 and 2010. That exposed the rock underneath to the ice, altering the drainage divide and forcing the two neighbours to redraw around a 100-metre-long stretch of their border.Wicht said such adjustments were frequent and were generally settled by comparing readings by surveyors from the border countries, without getting politicians involved.“We are squabbling over territory that isn’t worth much,” he said. But he added that this “is the only place where we suddenly had a building involved”, giving “economic value” to the land.His Italian counterparts declined to comment “due to the complex international situation”.Jean-Philippe Amstein, a former Swisstopo chief, said such disputes were typically resolved by exchanging parcels of land of equivalent surface area and value. In this case, “Switzerland is not interested in obtaining a piece of glacier”, he said, and “the Italians are unable to compensate for the loss of Swiss surface area”.While the outcome remains secret, the refuge’s caretaker, 51-year-old Lucio Trucco, has been told it will stay on Italian soil. “The refuge remains Italian because we have always been Italian,” he said. “The menu is Italian, the wine is Italian, and the taxes are Italian.”The years of negotiation have delayed the refuge’s renovation – the villages either side of the border have not been able to issue a building permit. The works will therefore not be completed in time for the scheduled opening of a new cable car up the Italian side of the Klein Matterhorn mountain in late 2023. The slopes are only accessible from the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt.While some mid-altitude resorts are preparing for the end of Alpine skiing due to global heating, skiing is possible throughout the summer on the Zermatt-Cervinia slopes, even if such activities contribute to the glacier’s retreat.“That’s why we have to enhance the area here, because it will surely be the last one to die,” said Trucco.For now, on Swisstopo’s maps, the solid pink band of the Swiss border remains a dashed line as it passes the refuge.Fire chiefs have warned that cities in the UK need to prepare for wildfires after dozens of “unprecedented” blazes broke out during last week’s record-breaking temperatures.Temperatures reached 40C (104F) across England last Tuesday in a heatwave that dried out green spaces, triggering wildfires that destroyed more than 40 houses and shops.The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) tactical adviser, David Swallow, told the BBC that “services need to recognise the risk they’ve now got”.“If they don’t, then they’re naive,” he said. “There are very urban services that think that wildfires are low down on the risk list. I understand the need to prioritise resources, but there needs to be a review.”According to the NFCC, this year alone England and Wales have had 442 wildfires – which compares with 247 last year. This is, in part, due to climate factors, so fire safety advice should be followed not only during the heatwave, but throughout the year, the NFCC said.The head of the London fire brigade, Andy Roe, said fires in the capital last week were unprecedented: “I saw stuff this week that I had not expected to see as a London firefighter.”The fire service saw its busiest day since the second world war as a result of the extreme temperatures, with crews attending 1,146 incidents in a single day.Asked about the experience of the capital’s fire services over the course of the week, Roe said: “I think the word I’d use is unprecedented. I’ve had a long operational career at some of the most significant incidents that London has seen in the past couple of decades but even with all that experience I saw stuff this week that I had not expected to see as a London firefighter.”Sixteen homes were lost in the large fire in Wennington, east London, and fire crews had to fight to save the fire station itself, located nearby, from the flames.A senior US official has urged China to do more to rein in Myanmar’s military after its execution of four people, saying that “it cannot be business as usual with the junta”, as the killings drew widespread international condemnation.State department spokesperson Ned Price told a briefing: “Arguably, no country has the potential to influence the trajectory of Burma’s next steps more so than the PRC [People’s Republic of China]”, noting that the junta “has not faced the level of economic and in some cases diplomatic pressure that we would like to see”.Price noted in-depth discussions had already been held with China and India on how to put Myanmar back on the path to democracy.US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who met activists from Myanmar in Bangkok this month, voiced confidence the killings would not hinder the country’s democracy movement. “The regime’s sham trials and these executions are blatant attempts to extinguish democracy; these actions will never suppress the spirit of the brave people of Burma,” Blinken said in a statement, using Myanmar’s former name.We condemn the Burmese military’s executions of pro-democracy activists and elected leaders Ko Jimmy, Phyo Zeya Thaw, Hla Myo Aung, and Aung Thura Zaw. These executions demonstrate a further escalation in the level of regime brutality and horrific violence. pic.twitter.com/RzjPHRNBRhThe remarks came after China, a longtime ally of Myanmar’s military, refused to comment on the executions. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing “always upholds the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs”.The execution on Monday of four prisoners including a former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party and a prominent democracy activist, was Myanmar’s first use of capital punishment in decades, and has heightened concerns that more death sentences will follow. Since the coup in February last year, 76 prisoners have been sentenced to death, including two children, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) Burma. A further 41 people have been sentenced to death in absentia.Global condemnation has followed, with attention turning to what can be done to prevent further atrocities. A joint statement from the European Union, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Britain and the United States called the killings “reprehensible acts of violence that further exemplify the regime’s disregard for human rights and the rule of law”.The UN special rapporteur Thomas Andrews said he was “outraged and devastated” by the executions and called for a strong international response. “The widespread and systematic murders of protesters, indiscriminate attacks against entire villages, and now the execution of opposition leaders, demands an immediate and firm response by member states of the United Nations,” he said.Myanmar’s junta lashed out on Tuesday against the international condemnation, saying the four executed prisoners “deserved many death sentences.”Spokesman Zaw Min Tun insisted the men “were given the right to defend themselves according to court procedure”.“If we compare their sentence with other death penalty cases, they have committed crimes for which they should have been given death sentences many times,” he said at a regular press briefing in the capital Naypyidaw. “They harmed many innocent people. There were many big losses which could not be replaced.”Aung Myo Min, the human rights minister in Myanmar’s national unity government (NUG), which was formed in exile by elected politicians, ethnic minority representatives and activists, earlier rejected the allegations the killed men were involved in violence, telling the Associated Press: “Punishing them with death is a way to rule the public through fear.”The United Nations also condemned the executions, with human rights chief Michelle Bachelet calling them “cruel and regressive”. A spokesperson for António Guterres said the secretary general opposes the death penalty “in all circumstances” and urged the immediate release of all arbitrarily detained prisoners, including President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.Myanmar expert Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group said the executions were “an outrageous act. And one that will create political shock waves, now and for a long time to come”.Among the executed men were Phyo Zeya Thaw, a rapper and former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, and the prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, known as Jimmy. They were accused of conspiring to commit terror acts and were sentenced to death in January in closed trials.The two other executed men – Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw – were accused of killing a woman they suspected was a military informer in Yangon, according to Agence France-Presse.Local media reported that the families of the men had travelled to Insein prison in Yangon demanding to see their loved ones’ bodies. Prison officials refused to hand the body over to relatives, a source close to the family of Kyaw Min Yu said, despite prison regulations stating it must do so unless there is a special reason.A total of 14,847 people have been arrested since the coup, while 11,759 remain in detention, according to AAPP Burma.Airline passengers are skipping queues at Heathrow by pretending to need wheelchairs after watching a video showing this on TikTok, the airport’s boss has said.John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, told LBC radio that some passengers were using the wheelchair support available to try to get fast-tracked through the airport, adding that this was “the wrong thing to be doing”.He told LBC: “For passengers requiring wheelchair support we have more demand than we had before the pandemic. Why is that happening? Some of this is because people are using the wheelchair support to try to get fast-track through the airport. That is absolutely the wrong thing to be doing.”He added: “If you go on TikTok you’ll see that that is one of the travel hacks that people are recommending. Please don’t do that.”In June a TikTok user uploaded a video of themselves having pretended to have an injured ankle and been given a wheelchair while flying from Ibiza to Bristol. The video showed the user removing their shoe, and was captioned: “Faking hurting my leg to get through security faster and on to the plane.”Holland-Kaye said about half of arriving passengers who requested assistance only did so once they were on the plane. He urged people who “really need the service” to let Heathrow know “well in advance so we can make sure there are enough people there to meet your needs”.Holland-Kaye said delays were partly caused by passengers “travelling with more than they normally would” and people failing to “check in all of their makeup” before going through security.Many travellers using the airport this summer have faced long queues, with the situation blamed on staff shortages. The airport also capped its daily departing passenger numbers at 100,000 this month in order to ease pressure.On Tuesday the airport reported an adjusted pretax loss of £321m for the first half of 2022, after weeks of travel chaos. Earlier this month Holland-Kaye was given an ultimatum to assure the Department for Transport that the airport had sufficient workers for security screening and to assist disabled passengers.Tunisian president Kais Saied celebrated the almost certain victory of the “yes” vote in a referendum on a new constitution that strengthens the powers of the head of state and risks the return of authoritarian rule in the birthplace of the Arab Spring.The referendum, held a year to the day after Saied sacked the government and froze parliament in what rivals have called a coup, saw at least 27.5% of 9.3 million registered voters cast ballots, Tunisia’s ISIE electoral commission said late on Monday after polls closed.An overwhelming 92-93% of those who voted supported the new constitution, according to an exit poll taken by the Sigma Conseil institute. Initial results are due on Tuesday afternoon.After the projected outcome was announced on national television, Saied supporters drove cars in procession through central Tunis, waving flags and beeping their horns, with some singing the national anthem or shouting “We would sacrifice our souls and our blood for you, Saied!”At around 2am local time on Tuesday, the president appeared in front of a jubilant crowd.“Tunisia has entered a new phase,” he said, according to local television, adding that “there was a large crowd in the polling stations and the rate would have been higher if the vote took place over two days”.Turnout on the day was higher than many observers had expected, showing that Saied continues to enjoy personal popularity almost three years into his mandate.Without naming them, the president promised “all those who have committed crimes against the country will be held accountable for their actions”.Saied’s critics have warned the new constitution would lock in presidential powers that could tip Tunisia back into dictatorship.The new text would place the president in command of the army, allow him to appoint a government without parliamentary approval and make him virtually impossible to remove from office.He could also present draft laws to parliament, which would be obliged to give them priority.The referendum generated few ripples across a region that is still regrouping after 10 years of direct challenges to the foundations of its autocracies, which sparked a groundswell of hope that citizens, rather than autocrats, could shape their own destinies.As revolutions were overturned by military coup in Egypt, by Saudi intervention in Bahrain and – eventually – by Gulf support for Syria’s government, Tunisia was seen as the last hope among the moves to reset the contract between citizen and state, and redefine how politics was done in the Middle East.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have emerged as supporters of Saied, who now appears to have a clear path to transforming the country’s governance from a hybrid parliamentary system to a presidential model that gives him a vicelike grip on the country.“Tunisia is a clear example of how the perspectives of the international leadership on democratic transition are distorted at best,” said Nancy Okail, a human rights advocate and CEO of the Centre for International Policy. “Although Tunisia was on the right track of political reform, the economic challenges coupled with corruption had been ringing the alarm bells well before Saied’s presidency. A power grab was his answer to the challenges.“The regional dynamics 11 years on are certainly not promising,” she added. “The transactional relationship between the west and the region, prioritising oil, with a narrow view of security and the normalisation of relations with autocrats are only making things worse.“The failures and fragility of these states in the midst of the food crisis and alarming global economic trends and climate crisis will increase the likelihood of further conflicts in the region, which will set us back to a situation that is far more dangerous than 11 years ago.”Many voters seemed oblivious to the content of the referendum, or unconcerned by the wide-ranging powers it gave the country’s president. Apathy and fatigue had become constants in Tunisia’s political discourse, which had been beset by corruption and economic woes over the course of several democratically elected governments.While many view Saied’s moves as a nail in the coffin of the Arab spring, other observers say change on such a scale needs a generational and historical perspective.“Of course, today’s referendum in Tunisia is a setback for the rooting of a democratic culture in Tunisia,” said HA Hellyer, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “But the history of revolutionary change across the world is like that: a step forward, a step back, and so on. Tunisia, and frankly the Arab world, is no different.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportThe principal of the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, where an intruder shot dead 19 students and two teachers in May, has been suspended from her job.Mandy Gutierrez of Robb elementary school was put on paid administrative leave on Monday, her attorney Ricardo Cedillo said in a statement to the Associated Press.The Uvalde school district superintendent made the decision to place Gutierrez on leave, Cedillo said.Gutierrez had worked in the Uvalde school district for more than two decades and was finishing her first year as principal when the killings there occurred, according to a preliminary investigative report released on 17 July by the Texas state legislature.Cedillo did not provide any details on why Gutierrez was suspended.The decision against Gutierrez is only the latest against an official in the wake of the report’s release.After initially being put on paid leave as the report was being prepared, the Uvalde school district police chief, Pete Arredondo, saw his pay halted on Friday, five days after the report’s release.The school board had called a meeting on Saturday to consider Arredondo’s firing but ultimately postponed it, citing “due process requirements” and a request from Arredondo’s attorney.The 77-page report from the state legislature’s special investigative committee laid responsibility at Gutierrez and a school assistant for knowing that the lock on a classroom in which the massacre took place was not working but not getting it fixed.In addition to the 21 people killed during the shooting, 17 were wounded.Other parts of the report detailed several failures at various levels in the years leading up to the mass shooting at Robb as well as on the day of the massacre.According to the special committee report, nearly 400 officers went to the elementary school as the shooting began, but a lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies meant police failed to confront the shooter quickly.“In this crisis, no responder seized the initiative to establish an incident command post,” the committee wrote in its report.“Despite an obvious atmosphere of chaos, the ranking officers of other responding agencies did not approach the Uvalde [school district] chief of police or anyone else perceived to be in command to point out the lack of and need for a command post, or to offer that specific assistance.”On Monday, the district school board also announced that the district school year would be pushed back to 6 September. The district intends to use the extra time to install additional security measures while also providing emotional and social support services, ABC News reported.There are now more than 1,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in New York City, which continues to be a hotspot for the virus, health officials said on Monday.New York reached 1,040 cases as of Monday, said the most recent information released by the city. That accounts for about a quarter of all of the confirmed cases in the US.The US leads the world in confirmed cases, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). As of Monday, there were 3,846 confirmed cases in the US and 18,095 globally, the CDC said. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency on Saturday.The virus is spreading primarily among men who have sex with men, research has shown. Close sexual contact was responsible for transmission in 95% of cases, one recent study found.There is a divide in New York City’s health department over whether the agency should advise gay men to change their sexual behavior amid the outbreak.Even as cases in New York have surged, officials have struggled to respond with adequate vaccination and testing. At the end of June, as New Yorkers scrambled to get a limited supply of monkeypox vaccines, there were 300,000 doses sitting in a warehouse in Denmark, the New York Times reported on Monday. Then, once officials decided to send those doses to the US, they arrived slowly, missing a chance to slow the spread of the virus.New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, also announced on Monday that the state had reached an agreement with Quest Diagnostics to use a PCR test on people who have a rash consistent with monkeypox.“The real challenge with testing is that it involves swabbing lesions, which must be present for the test to assess whether the virus is also present,” the New York state health commissioner, Mary Bassett, said in a statement. “Without lesions, testing is not currently possible. And we will continue working to make sure providers know when and how to test for monkeypox.”Cars beep their horns as they turn off Parliament Square, tourists stop to chat and a protester with long white hair stands up on the railings at the end of a traffic island, as if on the prow of a pirate ship heading for Westminster. In the shade on one side of the street is Steve Bray, also known as Stop Brexit Man, slightly pink-faced under his top hat, tapping an unlit cigarette on its packet. He is planning to get back to vaping, he says, “but let’s get these stressful days out of the way first”. Every so often, a passerby will stop to shake his hand.In the five years Bray has been protesting here, the past few weeks have been among the most memorable. At the end of June, police seized two of his amplifiers, and today there is a group of police officers watching him. The new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act strengthens police powers to place conditions on protests – even one-person protests – to control noise levels; it also increases the “controlled” area around parliament. “I feel that was kind of aimed at me,” he says. “So last week, on the Tuesday, they warned me twice. I said: ‘Look, I’m a protester, we’re about sound and vision – I’m not altering how we protest. It’s up to you what you do.’ They gave me two warnings.”In retaliation he put the Italian antifascist song Bella Ciao on, “and I went to the front [of the traffic island] with Gareth [he of the long white hair] to wave the flags. I could see them coming down to seize the stuff. I’m trying to wrap my leg around one amp; Gareth is holding on as well. We were doing everything we could to stop them taking the amps.” He says there were “at least 20 officers in the end”, and his microphone got broken. Is he worried about the prospect of prosecution? “Not in the slightest because what I’m doing is right, and what they’re doing is wrong.”He describes the new powers as “fascist”: “People who feel so passionately that they have to protest, they’ve been put in that position by a government which is trying to shut them up; this is why I say it’s fascism. Our right to protest is fundamental and we’re all being attacked.” A few days after we speak, Bray posts a video on Twitter of a conversation with a police officer who says he has been ordered to stay with Bray all day. “This is not North Korea, this is not the Soviet Union: you are not following me around all day,” Bray tells him.On the day we speak, in early July, Bray has another amp, “an old one, which is on its way out, but I’ve been using it. Today the police are ‘advising’ me, not warning me. So every time I play it, they come over and ‘advise’ me. They’ve changed tack. I’m not going to push it too far today.” That morning – in the background of a Good Morning Britain broadcast – he had played Bye Bye Boris, a parody song: “I’ve played it so much it’s driving me nuts.” As government ministers start resigning one after the other, people turn up to join the protest – about 40 over the course of the day, Bray says, in addition to the usual four or five core members. And money has poured into his crowdfunder – more than £180,000 was donated in the time since his amps were seized, he reports; the total now stands at about £230,000 – which pays for him to keep going. There is, he says, “a hell of a lot of support and it’s growing week on week”.When we speak again a couple of days later, he has made it on to TV again, this time playing the Benny Hill theme tune in the background of media broadcasts; a clip of the Conservative MP Chris Philp being interviewed on Sky News, the music playing as he spoke, went viral. The actor Hugh Grant had tweeted Bray that morning to request it. “I thought, OK,” says Bray, who stood on the ramp to the underground car park by College Green. “I know where to make a noise where nobody can do anything about it. I could see somebody on the corner waiting to go [on TV]; I didn’t realise it was Chris Philp. I thought it was a presenter, but I saw when he started and I just went for it.” He laughs.Bray has become an enduring presence on TV, moving in to shot, or shouting, during broadcast interviews. “We’re about getting the message out. I would always rather be silent and just stand behind with a placard. But my view is if you can’t be seen, you’ve got to be heard. In shutting me out, they are actually making it a bit worse for themselves – someone silent in the background, or someone shouting or playing what I like to call trolling songs?” Politicians have sworn at him and mocked him – his tactic of following and filming them, while insistently shouting questions, is clearly annoying and at times uncomfortable in its aggression – and he isn’t exactly popular with TV presenters and camera crews (nor, I suspect, with a large number of viewers who would rather listen to a broadcast without Bray disrupting it). “I do feel sorry for them,” he says. “They say: ‘This is our job. We set up here; we’ve only got a couple of minutes.’ But I say: this is for our futures; this is for all of us.”It can be difficult to understand the intensity of feeling that leads to someone giving their life over to a protest like this, standing in a square day after day, shouting and berating politicians. Bray likes to say he had never been on a protest in his life until the Brexit protest. In the run-up to the referendum on the UK’s EU membership, he was living in Port Talbot in Wales. “I know how much money the European Union had put into Port Talbot, one of the most deprived areas of the United Kingdom, and I was shocked at people there: that the majority voted to leave.” He believed, he says, the leave campaigns were lying. “What they promised, I knew there was no way they could deliver it. Port Talbot, a poor community, were being cheated out of a better life: being told they were going to get a better life when in fact they were going to be far worse off. I’m not an economist but I knew from the get-go it was all lies. Here we are, and it’s actually worse than I expected.”He started posting online, then realised he needed “to move offline because I wasn’t achieving anything. It was just arguments and trolls. It took up so much time and it achieved very little.” He says he volunteered to drive a float from a carnival in Germany – featuring a huge model of Theresa May with a gun in her mouth – around London and Norwich, and joined other anti-Brexit protesters. Following the snap election in 2017, May made a deal with the DUP to give Northern Ireland £1bn to prop up the minority government, and Bray spent a week living on the streets in London, sleeping in Hyde Park, to protest against it. “The point was I couldn’t spend any money, therefore I wasn’t paying any tax for that week. It was called ‘not a penny more’.” For the last couple of days of that week he stood outside parliament with his EU flags, and he became a full-time protester.The numbers joining him grew, and they were there Monday to Friday for the first year; they also went on marches and to party conferences. Bray and the group moved to the traffic island at the beginning of last year to get more attention, even if the noise, cars and people can be draining. He has also been attacked and spat at by members of the far right, had “cuts and grazes” and his trousers ripped. “I’m trying to watch all the time. You’ve got agitators, the police. I’m watching for the MPs, the cars.” They are there a few times a week, especially on days with key votes. How much of it is still about Brexit? “Brexit was the start of something far bigger,” he says. “Our political system is very flawed. This government has shown how bad a system run on trust is. There is no integrity, no honour, no decency and no morals.” He would like to rejoin the EU, he says, “but we need to change [the political system] first”.Bray, 53, was born in Cardiff, but his father was in the RAF and he spent his childhood moving around, living on military bases in Germany for many years, which he thinks created a feeling of rootlessness. It also drew him to the idea of the EU, one of whose countries he vaguely planned to retire to. “I don’t belong anywhere, but everywhere, if that makes sense.”He was into punk music, and the anti-establishment spirit plainly stayed with him. As a teenager, he says, he was “quite a rebel, a bit of a handful”. With the family now back in Wales, living in Bridgend, Bray ran away to London when he was 15. He only lasted four weeks but it sounds adventurous – using a fake name, he says, he got a job in a canteen at the Lloyd’s of London insurance market, and lived in a burnt-out house in south London. The police stopped and searched him and, thinking he looked young, took him to the station where he eventually called his dad, who came up on the train to collect him.Back in Bridgend, he moved into a bedsit and started on a youth training scheme in retail. Shortly afterwards, he got together with a young woman and they moved into a council-owned static caravan; their daughter was born just before Bray turned 18. The relationship didn’t last: “We had our problems; we were both young.” When I ask what his daughter makes of his protest, he laughs sadly and says, “That’s a long story,” in a way that makes it clear he is not going to go into it, but adds: “We haven’t spoken in years.” He has grandchildren he has never met, though his own parents are close to them. Despite his troubled relationship with his parents as a teenager, he says everything is fine between them now.Bray worked as an electrical engineer, and also became a rare coin dealer, a passion he’d had since he was six. He sold a few of his most valuable ones at the start of his protest, “which covered me into the first year, and then the crowdfunding was set up”. The money donated pays for a flat in London and “keeps me going at the moment”. For a couple of months in 2019, Bray’s team – known as Stand of Defiance European Movement, or Sodem – rented an Airbnb flat in a townhouse on the same street as the Conservative party headquarters, around the corner from parliament. “We would start at six in the morning and finish at midnight. They were hard weeks but they were worth their weight in gold.”The protest has changed his life, given him a sense of purpose. “I’ve never met so many people in all my life. It’s given me an understanding of people, whatever their views. It’s brought me out of my shell. In a way, it’s a better life than the life I had, because I now have goals and things I want to achieve.” He is “a little bit more outgoing” than he was, he says. “I’m a bit more tolerant. I do try to put the shoe on the other foot and see it from the other angle, whereas before I never would.”He never expected to be in the public eye, he says, and there are downsides: he is regularly attacked online by people claiming he uses a fake name, and making other allegations about him. “I never really wanted it, but now it’s happened I want to use that 15 minutes of fame to do some good.” In the 2019 general election, Bray stood as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Cynon Valley, a Labour safe seat he knew he couldn’t win (he got 949 votes). “I didn’t actually want to be an MP,” he says. “I don’t want to be in that den of iniquity – that’s not my cup of tea. I’m happy to fight for people’s rights, but in a way I know best.” He can’t see a time that he won’t be protesting. “I think this has probably changed my life for ever. I think there’s so much wrong with this country. The mess will never be undone, but you have to start somewhere.” Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a letter of up to 300 words to be considered for publication, email it to us at guardian.letters@theguardian.comDan Watman had travelled an hour and a half to end up just 200ft from his own home.Watman had come to the American side of Friendship Park, a binational park on the western end of the US-Mexico border where for decades families have met to connect with relatives, to talk about the local native flora in the public garden he runs there.Through the two walls securing the border, he could see his house in Playas de Tijuana, Mexico. But crossing the border from Tijuana to San Diego could take him between 90 minutes and four hours.“The root systems for some of the native plants in this area are as deep as 30 feet,” Watman said, talking over the sounds of live music from the food festival happening on the other side of the border in Tijuana. He pointed at a toyon bush, the biggest plant in the Binational Friendship Garden of Native Plants. “There’s probably roots on both sides,” he said with a chuckle.Watman is a longtime member of Friends of Friendship Park, a coalition that includes environmentalists, developers and immigrant rights activists advocating for public access to the historic border park. This month, the group announced it had learned that the US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, had approved plans to replace the two existing walls with new ones that will be as tall as the roots of his plants are deep.The new 30ft structures would extend walls stretching east that were built during the Trump administration, the group said, despite a campaign promise from Joe Biden to halt any new construction of the border wall. The new walls, the advocates warned, could further limit public access to the park, restricting visits to Watman’s garden or the wall.Watman was surprised at the Biden administration’s reversal, he said, but not at there being a new challenge to Friendship Park. “It’s not surprising given what I’ve seen and how things have gradually closed down more and more over the last 15 years. But it’s really disappointing.”Friendship Park was established more than 50 years ago by the then first lady, Pat Nixon, who inaugurated Border Field state park and gave the park’s corner its name by saying it was the beginning of the creation of an “international friendship park”.For a while, the only marker of the border here was a rope, barbed wire and then a chain-link fence. Families living in both countries would come together for picnics at the park. In 1988, a local couple got married there. It was a spot for families separated by the border to introduce US children to their grandparents in Mexico.Watman organized his first cross-border cultural exchange event in the early 2000s. He invited volunteer lifeguards in Tijuana and students from a community college in San Diego to meet at the beach in Friendship Park. Each group showed up with prejudices about what the other group would be like, he recalled. “But all those ideas melted away when they got to know each other through the fence. It was almost like the fence motivated them to want to get to know each other more, to kind of transcend that barrier,” he said.It would be the first of many experiences. Later came yoga classes, salsa dancing lessons, poetry readings and, eventually, the garden. “I decided trying to get people to make friends across borders was going to be my contribution to a better world,” he said.Watman has tended the garden for years, even as security alongside the border was tightened. By 2011, two walls had been built, one bollard-style wall closer to Mexico and one white fence with thinner slats closer to the US. Friendship Park was squeezed between the two. The Friends of Friendship Park negotiated with the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to include a pedestrian gate that would allow access to this no man’s land. Through it, visitors could get close to the three spots that make up Friendship Park today: the Binational Garden, the Monument erected as a boundary marker after the US-Mexico war, and a small, undeveloped beach.Robert Vivar, another Friends of Friendship Park leader, first visited the park in 2014, after he was deported from the US to Mexico.He was struggling with depression and anxiety, living in a country he hadn’t lived in since he was six. “I was kind of lost. I was not sure of what was going to happen to my life. So I started searching for something,” he recalled. His search led him to volunteer at various organisations, including one for deported veterans, and at the Border church, a binational communion service held at the Monument.“At first it was very difficult for me to go to Friendship Park. I could not look over the border wall into San Diego; it was too painful.” But he kept going, he said. Every Sunday he’d show up early, help unload chairs, set up the sound system and translate when needed.“Something started happening within me that this despair, this anxiety, this depression, that I was living with every day, was subsiding. The more I got involved, the lesser the pain.”Like the binational garden, the Border church went through many iterations. When US participants were allowed through the pedestrian gate, they’d meet next to the Monument. That section of wall has mesh siding big enough for a pinkie finger to poke through and people would touch pinkies during the Rite of Peace. Then they would be allowed to stroll down a designated path to the garden, where people could see their loved ones more clearly across the bollard fence. Vivar remembers one time his own son and two granddaughters met him at the wall. It “elevated the hope-meter”, he said.In 2019, Vivar said, the Border church invited members of the local Muslim community to celebrate what he called Border mosque. The US representative Rashida Tlaib attended. “From Palestine to Mexico, these walls must go,” Vivar recalled her saying. And, he added: “It’s true, they must go. But not only the physical barriers, the barriers in our heart. If we can get rid of those, the physical ones will follow with no problem.”Watching families come together across the wall over the years had been bittersweet, Vivar said, and he began looking forward to being permanently reunited with his own loved ones. This finally happened when he was allowed back into the US in 2021, on Veteran’s Day.In 2020, access to Friendship Park was shut down and the pedestrian gate was closed. Since then, a US border patrol truck has been parked in front of it, ready to sound its siren if anyone gets too close. Vehicle access to this corner of Border Field state park is now only available on the weekends. During the week, visitors have to walk 1.5 miles from the park entrance.Watman hasn’t been allowed to tend to the garden on the US side, and it’s become dry and overgrown. On the Mexican side, he and his team of volunteers have cultivated flourishing local plants, established food beds and organised educational events. “The Kumeyaay people were coming here for 8,000 years, and this border’s been here for 170 or something, like a blink of an eye … So we’ve had native plant workshops where we invited Kumeyaay elders to the garden,” Watman said.The activists worry the new stretches of fence could curtail access even further. In a statement earlier this month, they said officials with CBP had said the new walls would not include a pedestrian gate.In a statement to the Guardian, CBP said the agency recognized the value of having a safe meeting space on both sides of the border. “Upon completion of the San Diego Friendship Circle project, including the replacement of a secondary barrier with a pedestrian gate in this area, we will identify opportunities to provide the public with access once it is operationally safe to do so. While these opportunities will continue to need to be based on other US border patrol operational requirements, the replacement construction project will not be an impediment to potential opportunities for future access in this location,” the agency said.Friendship Circle refers to the area around the Monument, but not the binational garden, Watman said.Even if the new plans do include a gate, he added, there’s no guarantee that it will be open, and no way for the community to negotiate its access to this public land: “A gate is not a park.”The plan “desecrates the aesthetic of the park, desecrates it completely”, said Vivar. “There’s no reason for two 30-foot walls.”Friends of Friendship Park is asking CBP to pause construction until the organizations meet on 27 July. “It’s very important that the public, the stakeholders, have input as to what’s going on in the park,” said Vivar. “Border walls or not, we’re one community. And people on both sides of the border, there might be a fence to divide us, but the fences in our heart are being broken down every day. And they’re not going to stop us from having that relationship.”Watman said there was not much that ccould stop him from showing up at the garden, either. “It would be much more likely that I would stop if the walls came down than if the walls keep getting bigger. As long as there’s walls here and the US border policy only includes enforcement, there needs to be someone pushing for the other aspect that also is part of security, like cross-border friendship.”More than 80 days after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, we would like to hear from those living in Russia on what the mood is like in the country.How are you, family and friends feeling about the situation at the moment?

The second phase was dominated by Russia’s 152mm artillery, bombing cities to rubble before its ground forces gradually moved in.But the talk now is of the impact of the US-made Himars rocket artillery, which the Ukrainian forces have been using to halt the Russian advance by striking ammunition dumps in the rear – 50 according to the country’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov – and whether they can create the conditions for a successful advance towards Kherson, one of the largest cities captured by the invaders.Kherson, captured in early March, has long been a focus for the Ukrainians, with the defenders making limited gains in the countryside between Mykolaiv and the target city since April. But, apparently helped by the longer-range weapons, with an effective firing distance of up to 50 miles (80km), the Ukrainians are growing more confident.Sergiy Khlan, an aide to the administrative head of the Kherson region, told Ukrainian TV a turning point had been reached, and the region “will definitely be liberated by September”. It is a bold claim on the available evidence, and perhaps not surprisingly, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, instead talked about liberating Kherson “step by step”.The Himars – of which Ukraine has 12 with four more on their way – appear to be having an impact in allowing Kyiv’s forces to target four key bridges leading into Kherson. The city, the only Russian stronghold west of the Dnieper River, is obviously strategically vulnerable if Ukraine can muster the force to push the occupiers out.But the tale of the bridges partly illustrates some of the difficulties Ukraine faces in recapturing its population centres. Social media postings by Khlan make clear that Ukraine’s goal is not to destroy key bridges, in this case the Dariv Bridge across the Inhulets River east of the city, but rather to damage them to the point where the Russians cannot transport heavy equipment across them.The Ukrainian military wants to ensure that food supplies can still cross into the city, and so, Khlan added, the country’s armed forces would “do everything possible not to destroy the structure”. That may be a difficult balance to strike, even allowing for the greater accuracy of the Himars – but more importantly it reveals a key constraint on the Ukrainians’ ability to strike back.Russian officials, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, acknowledged damage to another of the key bridges, near the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, across the Dnieper, about 40 miles to the east of Kherson. The damage, the Russians said, came from Himars rocket artillery, but the news agency shortly after released pictures to show workers apparently filling in a hole in the road.If cutting off the city by destroying the bridges is challenging, then capturing it, given the remaining civilian population, will be harder. Russia has shown it was willing to destroy cities such as Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk before capturing them. But for Ukraine – seeking to liberate its own territory – that is not obviously an option. Dislodging the Russians may be difficult if they choose to stay in the city itself.Nor is it obvious that the arrival of one longer-range weapon can create the conditions for a more rapid overall advance. Ukraine has no meaningful air power available, so it must rely on an assembling a preponderance of ground forces against an enemy that has held the city for nearly five months. Meanwhile, western supplies continue to arrive gradually rather than in the numbers Ukraine needs.Reznikov said on Monday the first three of 15 Gepard mobile artillery guns promised by Germany back in April had arrived in Ukraine, and that he hoped to take delivery of several dozen Leopard tanks soon – most likely from Spain. The increasing supply may help Ukraine tip the balance on one part of the front, but so far there has been no evidence the defenders can manage a breakthrough.After four months of gradual Russian advance in the east and the south, the arrival of Himars and rocket artillery looks to have tilted the military balance towards an equilibrium. But it is not yet obvious that the invaders can be rolled back: perhaps no wonder then that Khlan optimistically suggested the best option for the Russians was to voluntarily surrender Kherson.The European Union has decided to renew its sanctions against Russia for a further six months, until the end of January 2023.The decision, a formality taken by EU energy ministers, refers to sanctions that were first introduced in 2014 and significantly expanded after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February this year.Ministers approved a draft European law meant to lower demand for gas by 15% from August through to March.The new legislation entails voluntary national steps to reduce gas consumption and, if they yield insufficient savings, a trigger for mandatory moves in the 27-member bloc.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the move, saying that “the EU has taken a decisive step to face down the threat of a full gas disruption by [Russian president Vladimir] Putin”.Ukrainian soldier Mykola Zabavchuk planned to marry his girlfriend when he next returned home from the war against Russia, but never made it back.Zabavchuk, who was 25, and two other soldiers were buried in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Tuesday after being killed in action, Reuters reported.“He was a very good boyfriend, a sincere one. He loved and took care of me very much. He was very devoted to me and to his friends,” his fiancee, Oleksandra, told Reuters at the funeral.“Before his departure, he proposed. We planned a wedding after the rotation. It was not destined [to come true].”At the funeral, a uniformed soldier held a portrait of Zabavchuk, smiling and cradling a dog under his right arm.“We have a little dog, Arei. It is in the picture. I will foster it, take care of it, he wanted this very much. He called it his son, [and] so it is.”Led by one soldier carrying a cross and another holding the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag, mourners formed a procession behind Zabavchuk’s coffin and those of two other soldiers.The Kremlin has insisted its decision to shut down the agency that processes Jewish migration to Israel should not be “politicised”, amid a widening rift between the two countries over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.Last week Russia’s justice ministry requested the liquidation of the Russian branch of the Jewish Agency, a private charity closely affiliated with the Israeli government that promotes migration to Israel.The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Tuesday that the ministry’s request came after the organisation, which has several offices in cities across the country, violated Russian laws.Russia’s defence ministry plans to hold strategic military exercises in the east of the country from 30 August to 5 September, news agencies reported on Tuesday.Interfax reported that the militaries of unspecified other countries will be taking part in the regular “Vostok” exercises, citing the defence ministry.A British citizen who video blogs pro-Kremlin material from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine has been added to a UK government sanctions list.Graham Phillips, who has been accused of being a conduit for pro-Russian propaganda, is one of 42 new designations added to the UK’s Russia sanctions list. Phillips – the first UK citizen to be added to the growing sanctions list – has long been a controversial figure, receiving medals from the Russian state for his reporting. He has consistently toed the Russian line on the war, suggesting in recent weeks that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that the massacre of Ukrainians in Bucha was staged.In April Phillips drew condemnation from Boris Johnson and others when he interviewed Aiden Aslin, a British member of the Ukrainian armed forces who had been captured by Russian forces during the siege of Mariupol. Aslin is facing the death penalty.Aslin’s local MP, Robert Jenrick, said Phillips’ video showed his constituent “handcuffed, physically injured and being interviewed under duress for propaganda purposes”. Jenrick said the video was a breach of the Geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war and that “the interviewer Graham Phillips is in danger of prosecution for war crimes”.Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report here: British pro-Kremlin video blogger added to UK government Russia sanctions listThe Interfax news agency is now quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirming that Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Sochi on 5 August.Peskov said the two leaders will discuss regional problems and bilateral relations – relations which presumably got slightly worse after Russia struck the port city of Odesa with cruise missiles just hours after signing an agreement brokered by Turkey and Erdoğan to allow grain shipments from Ukraine out of the port.Russia has not communicated to Nasa its intent to withdraw from the International Space Station in 2024, a senior agency official has told Reuters. Russia’s new space chief had claimed earlier that Moscow plans to pull out of the two-decade-old orbital partnership.The relationship between Russia and Nasa has become strained, after earlier this year three Russian cosmonauts appeared to display the flags of the unrecognised breakaway states occupying eastern Ukraine while on the ISS. Nasa issued a statement, saying the agency “strongly rebukes Russia using the International Space Station for political purposes to support its war against Ukraine.”Nasa went on to say the flying of the separatist flags “is fundamentally inconsistent with the station’s primary function among the 15 international participating countries to advance science and develop technology for peaceful purposes.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will hold a one-day visit to the Russian resort of Sochi on 5 August, his office has just announced.Reuters reports that no further details were immediately available, but it is anticipated that he would meet with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.EU member states have agreed to ration gas this winter, in an attempt to avoid an energy crisis generated by further Russian cuts to supply.Energy ministers from the 27 member states mostly backed a plan for a voluntary 15% reduction in gas usage over the winter, but added in several opt-outs for island nations and countries unconnected or little connected to the European gas network, which will blunt the overall effect.The European Commission had suggested that a collective 15% gas savings target would reduce gas consumption by 45bn cubic metres. Once exemptions are taken into account the final bcm tally will be lower, after a revolt led by southern European countries that use less or no Russian gas.The agreement comes less than 24 hours after Russia’s state-controlled energy firm, Gazprom, announced a steep reduction in gas supplies through the critical Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Wednesday. It came only days after Nord Stream 1 went back online at lower capacity, following summer maintenance.EU leaders have accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of attempting to blackmail European countries for supporting Ukraine. Russia has cut or reduced supplies to a dozen or so EU countries.Worries over insurance are the biggest obstacle to grain ships leaving Ukraine’s Black Sea ports this week, exporters say.Questions remain over whether insurance companies will be willing to insure the vessels as they navigate the mined waters, while buyers are hesitant to make new orders given the risk of Russian attacks.Russian missiles struck the main port of Odesa on Saturday, just 12 hours after Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, signed an agreement in Istanbul guaranteeing safe passage for Ukraine’s exports. Russia later said it had targeted a Ukrainian vessel at the port carrying western weapons, but did not present evidence.Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said on Monday that the first ships will leave their Black Sea ports this week, despite the attacks. Kubrakov, who signed on behalf of Kyiv, said that although Ukraine did not trust Russia, “it trusts its allies and partners, which is why the agreement … was signed with the UN and Turkey and not Russia”.The UK has sanctioned Sarvar and Sanjar Ismailov, nephews of major Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov who has close ties to the Kremlin.Sarvar Ismailov was previously a director at Everton Football Club and both have significant interests in the UK, the Foreign Office said.The leaders of the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine have also been hit with sanctions.Foreign secretary Liz Truss said: We will not keep quiet and watch Kremlin-appointed state actors suppress the people of Ukraine or the freedoms of their own people.We will continue to impose harsh sanctions on those who are trying to legitimise Putin’s illegal invasion until Ukraine prevails.A joint coordination centre (JCC) for Ukrainian grain exports under a UN-brokered deal will be opened in a ceremony in Istanbul on Wednesday, Turkey’s defence ministry said.Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations signed the accord last week to resume Ukraine’s grain exports, which had stalled after Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. All parties will appoint representatives at the JCC to monitor the implementation of the plan, Reuters reported.The European Union has decided to renew its sanctions against Russia for a further six months, until the end of January 2023.The decision, a formality taken by EU energy ministers, refers to sanctions that were first introduced in 2014 and significantly expanded after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February this year.Ministers approved a draft European law meant to lower demand for gas by 15% from August through to March.The new legislation entails voluntary national steps to reduce gas consumption and, if they yield insufficient savings, a trigger for mandatory moves in the 27-member bloc.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the move, saying that “the EU has taken a decisive step to face down the threat of a full gas disruption by [Russian president Vladimir] Putin”.The Kremlin said on Tuesday that it believes former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is in Moscow and did not rule out possible contact with him.“As far as we know, he is in Moscow,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked if the Kremlin was aware of reports that Schroeder had travelled to Moscow on Tuesday.“There is no meeting as such, but we do not rule out possible contact,” Peskov added.He was speaking a day after Russia’s Gazprom said it would cut gas supply to Germany via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to just 20% of capacity from Wednesday because of a turbine that it said needed to be halted. Germany rejected that explanation, Reuters reported.Schroeder has been a key figure in energy ties between the two countries, serving as chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005 before taking up a controversial position on the supervisory board of Russian state-controlled oil company Rosneft.The Russian state-controlled energy company Gazprom has announced a drastic cut to gas deliveries through its main pipeline to Europe from Wednesday, prompting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accuse Moscow of waging a “gas war”.The Russian gas export monopoly said it was halting the operation of one of the last two operating turbines due to the “technical condition of the engine”, cutting daily gas deliveries via the Nord Stream pipeline to 33m cubic metres a day – about 20% of the pipeline’s capacity.“We are monitoring the situation very closely in close exchange with the federal network agency and the gas crisis team,” the German economy ministry said in a statement on Monday after Gazprom’s announcement. “According to our information, there is no technical reason for a reduction in deliveries.”Zelenskiy, in his nightly video address on Monday, said the move was deliberate and urged the European Union to agree tougher sanctions against Russia. “All this is done by Russia on purpose to make it as difficult as possible for Europeans to prepare for winter. And this is an open gas war that Russia is waging against a united Europe,” he said. Moscow’s “gas blackmail of Europe” represented “an incentive for the EU’s eighth sanctions package to be significantly stronger,” he said. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline resumed pumping last week, after a 10-day maintenance break, but the European Commission has warned that a complete gas shut down by Russia is likely.The announcement came as EU governments sparred over a plan for a 15% gas savings target intended to avoid a winter crisis if the Kremlin turns off the taps to Europe. The EU’s goal is to use less gas now to build storage for winter.The EU executive last week accused Moscow of using energy as a “weapon” and called on 27 member states to accept a voluntary 15% gas savings target, which could become mandatory if Brussels declares a supply emergency.EU officials had hoped the bloc’s 27 energy ministers meeting in Brussels on Tuesday would rubber stamp the 15% gas savings plan. Instead countries from all corners of Europe have raised objections, led by Spain and Portugal, who are relatively isolated from the EU’s gas pipeline network.The proposals have been seen as designed for Germany, which faces energy rationing as it scrambles to undo decades of dependence on Russian gas. In an echo of the bruising debates of the eurozone crisis ten years ago, where arguments raged over bailouts, debt and blame, southern countries suggested their citizens should not have to make sacrifices for the past policies of others.Spain’s deputy prime minister Teresa Ribera said last week her country was being asked to make a “disproportionate sacrifice”, as she pointed to investments her country had made on liquefied natural gas infrastructure, costs that had fallen on Spanish companies and consumers, she said. “Unlike other countries, we Spaniards have not lived beyond our means from an energy point of view,” Ribera said in unusually pointed comments.Portugal was “totally against” the proposals its energy minister, João Galamba, told local media last week, saying they did not address the needs of Spain or Portugal, which have little gas interconnection with the rest of Europe. The Iberian countries are also using more gas to generate electricity because a fierce drought has reduced hydropower production.Greece also opposes the 15% EU-wide target, which it argues overburdens its economy and consumers.Meanwhile, Poland has raised concerns about its energy security. A Polish official said Warsaw would “not agree to any solutions that may lead to the use of Polish natural gas reserves for the needs of other member states”.France, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Poland were among the countries that opposed giving the commission the power to declare a supply emergency. Instead it is proposed that EU member states make that critical decision.Under revised proposals, which were still being discussed by EU deputy ambassadors on Monday, countries can get an exemption from the 15% target if they are not connected to the gas interconnector system of any other member states. The target can also be eased if countries offer to send gas to a member state in need.EU sources rejected suggestions the plan was designed for Germany, arguing all member states would feel the economic pain of a Russian gas shut down.“I don’t buy the logic that all this is for Germany,” said one senior EU official. “It’s not about who will be hit first because if [a supply shock] hits then I think the problem will be immediately shared. We are in the internal market and … the pain will be substantial for all member states.”The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, last week said it was likely the Kremlin would order a complete shutdown of Russian gas to the EU, dealing a hammer blow to the European single market. EU officials have suggested countries speed up the shift to renewables, but have also said states could consider delay to exiting coal and nuclear power.Belgium’s government announced last week it had reached a political agreement to extend the life of two nuclear power plants by 10 years, citing national security. The Doel 4 and Tihange 3 reactors will be restarted in 2026, as the Belgian government revised a plan to exit all nuclear power by 2025.A decade after its government admonished southern European states to “do their homework” of painful fiscal changes to end a sovereign debt crisis, Germany is slowly adapting to the humbling reality of being worst-in-class when it comes to reliance on Russian gas.As EU countries in recent days sought to agree on emergency proposals to curb their gas demand in reaction to Russia’s Gazprom throttling supplies to Europe, southern states made clear they were unwilling to sign up to a homogenous 15% cut in gas across countries with a less vulnerable energy mix than Germany. A deal was finally agreed on Tuesday. “They cannot demand a sacrifice from us for which we have not been asked for an opinion,” said Spain’s minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, adding: “We have not lived beyond our means in terms of energy.”While Germany as of the end of June remains reliant on Russian imports for about a quarter of its gas needs and scrambles to expand infrastructure to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), Spain has massively expanded its LNG structure and is now barely reliant on Russian gas imports.Recycling a phrase popular with German ministers at the height of the eurozone crisis, Ribera said: “We have done our homework.”Other southern states such as Portugal and Italy also signalled their opposition, forcing opt-outs to the emergency plans that would allow them to follow different national paths to prepare for Russian supply cuts.The turning of tables in the bloc of European states has not gone unnoticed in Germany. “Some states suffered heavily during the financial crisis and had to bear the lectures of the Germans,” wrote the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. “And now they are meant to massively save gas to bail out those same Germans, who have brought this situation on themselves with a misguided energy policy.”“The collateral damages that several [German] governments have left behind in the EU are too big”, said the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. “In building [the pipeline] Nord Stream 1, they ignore the energy and security interests of Poland and other central and eastern European states. And they always had to know best, most recently during the taxonomy disagreement over nuclear energy.”On Monday, the Russian state-owned Gazprom announced it would further halve gas deliveries to Europe via Nord Stream 1 from Wednesday, to 20% of the pipeline’s capacity.The company cited equipment repairs to a previously unnamed turbine, a reason that the German energy minister, Robert Habeck, described as a made-up pretext and a “farcical story” on Monday night.“Putin is playing a perfidious game,” Habeck told the news agency dpa. “He is trying to weaken the great support for Ukraine and drive a wedge into our society. To do this, he stirs up uncertainty and drives up prices. We are countering this with unity and concentrated action.”The archbishop of Canterbury has been forced to allow Anglican bishops from all over the world the option of rejecting a statement on sexuality when they meet in Canterbury this week for the Lambeth conference.The U-turn from Justin Welby, the leader of the global Anglican communion and the conference president, came late on Monday night, hours before 650 delegates began arriving for the 12-day meeting.It followed an outcry from liberal Anglicans and gay rights campaigners over a declaration – known as a Lambeth Call – on human dignity that defines marriage as “between a man and a woman”. It adds that “legitimising or blessing of same-sex unions” cannot be advised, and that “it is the mind of the Anglican communion as a whole that same-gender marriage is not permissible”.Among those protesting was the bishop of Los Angeles, John Harvey Taylor, who said the statement was “the opposite of the Christian values of healing and reconciliation. It divides, hurts, scapegoats and denies.”Bishops of the church in Wales said the call “undermines and subverts the dignity of an integral part of our community, rather than affirming them”.Monday evening’s statement from the Lambeth conference said: “Over recent days we have listened carefully to the responses of bishops … The drafting group for the Call on Human Dignity will be making some revisions to the Call.”It gave no further details, but said the revised text would be released “as soon as it is available”.The statement also announced that bishops would now have a third option in responding to the Lambeth Calls. “Bishops will now be able to clearly state their opposition to a particular Call in addition to supporting it or calling for further discussion. The third option will state: “This Call does not speak for me. I do not add my voice to this Call.”Jayne Ozanne, a prominent campaigner for LGBT+ equality in the Church of England, welcomed the move. But she added: “I am still deeply troubled by the tone of this communique. It does not appear to address any of the concerns relating to process that so many have flagged up, nor does it recognise the breakdown in trust that there is now in relation to the [discussions on sexuality and identity] here in England.”The issue of sexuality and same-sex marriage has caused deep divisions among Anglicans, both in the UK and globally, for decades. The Lambeth conference scheduled for 2018 was cancelled by Welby as it became apparent that differences were irreconcilable and would damage the global church.In 2016 a meeting of Anglican primates from around the world voted to impose de facto sanctions on the US Episcopal church for approving same-sex marriages and issued a statement reaffirming “traditional doctrine” that marriage should be between a man and a woman.Since then, the Scottish Episcopal church has decided to allow same-sex marriage and the Anglican church in Wales has voted to offer special blessings to same-sex married couples. The Church of England still bans same-sex marriages.Conservative church leaders from Rwanda, Nigeria and Uganda are boycotting the conference in protest at the support of some Anglican churches for same-sex unions.Welby is keen to focus this week’s Lambeth conference on issues such as the climate crisis and global inequality. In a message to bishops last week, he said: “Without ignoring those things on which we deeply disagree, I pray that we will approach this gathering with an even deeper sense of what unites us: the love of Jesus Christ and his calling to serve God’s world.”'),\n",

       "  'Scientists have found more than 30 potentially new species living at the bottom of the sea.Researchers from the UK’s Natural History Museum used a remotely operated vehicle to collect specimens from the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the central Pacific. Previously, creatures from this area had been studied only from photographs.The study, published in the journal Zookeys, found there is a high species diversity of larger organisms in the abyss. Of the 55 specimens recovered, 48 were of different species. The animals found include segmented worms, invertebrates from the same family as centipedes, marine animals from the same family as jellyfish, and different types of coral.Thirty-six specimens were found at more than 4,800 metres deep, two were collected on a seamount slope at 4,125 metres, and 17 were found at between 3,095 and 3,562 metres deep.The findings have potentially important implications for deep-sea mining, as humans become more interested in exploiting minerals from the seabed, because it seems the activity has the potential to disturb many creatures. The study’s lead author, Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras, of the Natural History Museum, said: “This research is important not only due to the number of potentially new species discovered, but because these megafauna specimens have previously only been studied from seabed images. Without the specimens and the DNA data they hold, we cannot properly identify the animals and understand how many different species there are.”Dr Adrian Glover, who leads the Natural History Museum’s deep-sea research group, said: “We know that millimetre-sized animals called macrofauna are extremely biodiverse in the abyss. However, we have never really had much information on the larger animals we call megafauna, as so few samples have been collected. This study is the first to suggest that diversity may be very high in these groups as well.”Europe has already endured a record amount of fire damage in 2022, as the continent has baked in extreme – and in some cases, unprecedented – high temperatures, Guardian analysis shows. In July, fires hit several countries across Europe. While Londoners were shocked when dozens of properties were hit by fires in last week’s heatwave, firefighters in Portugal, Spain, France and Greece were all battling forest fires across tens of thousands of hectares.These are part of a record-breaking fire season across Europe this year.Data from Effis shows that as of 23 July, just over 515,000 hectares (1.27m acres) of land had been burned across EU countries. This is four times the average recorded since 2006, and is nearly twice the previous record seen across this time.The scale of these fires can be seen in satellite data provided by Planet Labs. In La Teste-de-Buch, France, hundreds of hectares of forest burned as fires spread all the way to the ocean and nearby towns.In Spain, rural areas in Salamanca experienced some of the most worrying fires, and these can also be seen in satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs.Authorities said fires may have been started deliberately, although sun-baked, dry wooded hills were easily consumed once the fires started. The majority of the Iberian peninsula remains at extreme risk of fires after two heatwaves were registered since the start of the summer.Guardian analysis of temperature data since 1980 from Visual Crossing, a commercial weather data provider, found that seven of 28 European capital cities, including London, Rome and Dublin, had temperatures reach 40-year highs for June, July or both.London experienced its highest ever temperatures on 19 July. 40.2C was widely reported to have been recorded at Heathrow airport, but this figure remains provisional pending “assessment of the site and the equipment to ensure there are no anomalies with either”, according to a Met Office spokesperson. The figure of 39.8C in the Visual Crossing data still eclipses London’s previous July high of 36.1C, first reached in July 2019.A further five capitals, including Paris and Madrid, came within 0.5C of previous monthly highest temperatures.Though many EU capitals have so far escaped record-breaking temperatures this summer, wildfires have ravaged other areas of the countries. The extent of the fires points to the destructive effects of prolonged aberrant temperatures and dry conditions, regardless of whether temperature records are broken.Scientists told the Guardian that the role of human-caused global heating in such hot weather appeared clear, and research shows that the chances of breaking 40C in the UK without it would be less than 0.1%.Dr Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London, said 40C “would have been extremely unlikely or virtually impossible without human-caused climate change”.Data from the Berkeley Earth Land/Ocean Temperature Record shows that recent years have seen record divergences from the average global temperature recorded between 1951 and 1980. In 2016, global temperatures were 1.05C higher than this average – a record in the data that runs to 1850. The 13 hottest global temperatures in the data have all occurred since 2000.Scientists have said 40C heat in the UK could occur every three years if emissions are not lowered.The Met Office’s chief of science, Prof Stephen Belcher, said: “If we continue under a high emissions scenario, we could see temperatures like these every three years … The only way that we can stabilise the climate is by achieving net zero … soon.”There is an old saying, rather unloved by local people, that if you roll down the window while driving through Germany, you’ll always know from the smell when you are in Lower Saxony.This is the heartland of a €6bn (£5.1bn) pork industry that sends thousands of tonnes of German pigmeat across the world. But it has done so at a cost. Maps of the Schweinegürtel (pig belt) glow a toxic red if you show ammonia emissions from farm animals and nitrates in groundwater.Critics say local authorities in the region have allowed the industry to flourish while turning a blind eye to its environmental impact. While animal welfare has jumped up the public agenda, say campaigners, hotspots of intensive livestock farming and the pollution of waterways is not in many people’s minds.The sheer density of pigs in Lower Saxony is at the heart of the problem, explains Christine Chemnitz, director of the German agricultural thinktank Agora Agriculture.While animal manure is a source of agricultural fertiliser, overuse can lead to excess nitrates seeping into groundwater, where it can damage rivers, lakes and oceans.Almost 60% of pigs in Germany are found in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, its neighbouring state to the south. In some areas in Lower Saxony – home to more than 7 million pigs – the density of pigs is four times the national average.After the second world war, farming animals was one of the few industries available to make an income in the state known as the “poor house” of Germany. It had ample land to spread the pig manure and easy access to northern ports such as Hamburg for importing feed and other products.But, more recently, nitrates from the manure spread on agricultural land has been polluting local waterways, says Uwe Behrens, an environmental activist with the Alliance for People, Environment and Animals (Bündnis MUT).Behrens blames this pollution for the critical state of Lower Saxony’s Ahlhorner fish ponds, a 465-hectare (1,150-acre) conservation area that is home to several rare plant species. One of the ponds, fed by a river that flows through dense agricultural land, was found to have an excess of 133 tonnes of nitrates. “There’s way too much fertiliser in the water,” he says.Staff from the Ahlhorn forestry office have reportedly described the protected pond as a “giant sewage treatment plant” and said the attendant environmental degradation violates EU conservation laws.In South Oldenburg, where many of Lower Saxony’s pig farms are located, ammonia levels were found to be more than twice the upper limit of those deemed environmentally safe.But it is the nitrate issue that is the greatest environmental controversy in Lower Saxony. The state has Germany’s highest proportion of “red areas’’ – where nitrates measure above the EU nitrate directive limit of 50mg/l.The states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia are being sued by campaigners from Deutsche Umwelthilfe (Environmental Action Germany) for failing to tackle the issue. They say two-thirds of the groundwater in the region around Lower Saxony’s Ems River has been left in a “desolate state”.Reinhild Benning, a spokesperson for Deutsche Umwelthilfe and a former pig farmer, says hotspots of pig production and pollution such as Lower Saxony – where levels can reach three to four times the EU nitrogen limit – have emerged in areas where politicians have been willing to “look away” if things were not right.She says the government has been too willing to support an expansion of pig farming. The numbers of pigs in the region and the size of farms increased rapidly between 2004 and 2012, with Germany’s pork exports also more than doubling.In 2018, the country was found to have breached EU law by the European court of justice for failing to deal with the nitrate problem. More than a quarter of monitoring sites in agricultural land in Lower Saxony still exceed EU limits.“Environmental laws were watered down and new stalls in nitrogen-polluted areas were allowed to be constructed,” says Benning, adding that farms no longer have enough land to adequately spread the manure. “In Lower Saxony we saw, for example, farms with 500 pigs grow to 5,000 and then 10,000 pigs.”The German Farmers’ Union (Deutscher Bauernverband) says national regulations have been tightened significantly and that excess nitrogen discharged into the environment in Lower Saxony has been stopped this year.Government officials in Lower Saxony say problems caused by the rapid expansion of animal farming in the early 2000s were, belatedly, being tackled. “We are becoming a repair store for the decisions of the past,” said Olaf Lies, Lower Saxony’s environment minister.“In the times of general liberalisation, we relied on the sense of responsibility of companies and agriculture, and largely dispensed with regulatory controls. We now have a responsibility to reverse excessive developments to an acceptable level.”In 2021, Germany introduced stricter regulation around managing manure, which was approved by the European Commission in June. Yet not all are convinced that this is enough to rectify the dirty legacy of Germany’s pork success. The German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) says new regulations will not bring levels into line with EU legislation, and has criticised the government for proposing measurement models that “artificially reduced” red areas.Lies admits the repairs to soil and groundwater will not be immediate. “We will find the effects of past decisions and failures in control for a long time, until the effect of the [new] measures have an impact.”Behrens says Germans still do not fully recognise the environmental impact of the industry when they buy their pork: “Most consumers are not aware that we have too many animals on too little land.“Animal welfare is now in many people’s minds but not over-fertilisation, drinking-water quality or the loss of plant species.”This article was developed with the support of Journalismfund.euSign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations. You can send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.comThere were thousands of people on Robert Moses Beach on New York’s Long Island on Saturday, but in this heatwave few were venturing into the Atlantic water beyond their ankles or knees.Mothers kept their children close. An array of boats, helicopters and drones moved up and down beyond the surf. And teams of lifeguards aloft in their posts were poised with whistles to order people out of the water.“Even if we have a sighting of a shark we have to take everyone out of the water,” said Orlando Diaz, a lifeguard with 30 years’ experience who estimated that just on this stretch of beach the guards had already done so 10 times this year. “We see whales, we see dolphins, sometimes stingrays, but it kind of stinks when we have a shark sighting because it ruins the day for the beachgoers.”But, Diaz reasoned, “They belong in the ocean. We don’t.”That perspective – in essence, “our house, our rules” – is one that beachgoers have rapidly adapted to during the great (white) shark scare of 2022. There have been at least six shark-human encounters along this stretch of coast, none fatal, but some requiring medical attention.In early July, lifeguard Zach Gallo was playing a victim in a water training exercise when a 4-5ft-long shark bit him in his chest and right hand off Smith Point Beach, 70 miles east of Manhattan. Gallo was able to walk out of the water, bandaged and treated at a local hospital and soon returned to work.Two weeks later, after authorities stepped up patrols, a juvenile great white washed up on a beach nearby. The tide took the carcass away before scientists could study it.The waters off Long Island are known to marine biologists as a nursery for the species, and it’s a testament to oceanic health – and successful long-term conservation efforts – that they are here and feeding on schools of bait fish, mainly Atlantic menhaden. The rise in encounters is not complicated to explain: warmer sea temperatures mean more food and more reason for sharks to come around.“There’s also a dozen other species, including sand tiger sharks, sandbar sharks and dusky sharks, that share the habitat,” Tobey Curtis, a fishery management and migratory species specialist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a recent interview. “If there’s more sharks and more people in the same place at the same time there’s more chance of an interaction.”Most of the time, Curtis pointed out, sharks and people are very close to each other, with people simply unaware of it. But with more food, more sharks, and more people at the beaches escaping brutal heatwaves, interactions have become more commonplace.“The sharks’ natural food is close to the beaches, so the sharks are in there chasing their prey, and there’s thousands of New York swimmers in there, so that’s led to this cluster of bites,” Curtis adds. The likely culprits, he adds, are not young great whites but the sand tigers.But for many, the owner of the teeth – large or small – is of less concern than the teeth themselves. And of course their sharpness and the jaws behind them. One mother on Saturday said her kids weren’t going in the water.“I would still go in but maybe not that far out,” said Dawn Gary, laughing. “This is the shark’s home and we’re just using a little bit of it.”Another said she was telling her kids to stay close. “Because of the talk about it, it makes you think about it, so even I didn’t go in much further than the kids,” Suzanne Francis said.Long Island surfer Scott Carberry said he had noticed changes in the water. Armadas of red jellyfish had vanished, and there was less seaweed.“All of a sudden we’re seeing tons of dolphin so I guess that means the waters are cleaner,” Carberry said.Still, the cleaner waters aren’t enough to entice Carberry’s wife, Liz.“I would normally go in but not this year,” she said. “I’m good. I don’t want to get bit by a shark.”Last week, in response to the rise in shark encounters, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, called on state agencies to implement increased patrols on the land, in the air with drones and helicopters, and at sea, and to expand education for beachgoers about sharks.Swimming, the governor said, would be suspended for at least an hour after a shark sighting, so that the shoreline can be inspected by a drone. “Our top priority is their safety,” Hochul added.Greg Metzger, chief field coordinator for the shark research and education program at the South Fork Natural History Museum in Bridgehampton, New York, said he had been catching, tagging and releasing lots of sharks of different species this year.Metzger said conservation efforts were starting to pay off, adding: “It’s not climate change, it’s not Donald Trump, not that sharks love to eat humans, it’s just positive conservation efforts that are helping prey and predator.”But, Metzger said, in percentage terms, with more sharks and humans both in the water, the chances of an “encounter” are probably the same as they ever were: near zero.However, for a species researcher, the summer of 2022 has been a godsend. “We’re catching the heck out of them and getting so much data it’s fantastic,” he said.Perhaps the best chance for swimmers to reduce shark-human encounters is becoming educated on when to swim – and how to do so more safely.Early morning and evening, when fish start moving and feeding in the low light, is not so good. If you see fish schooling, birds feeding, or whales and dolphins, then sharks will be in the area to potentially feed.“All the drones, lifeguards, helicopters in the world are not going to prevent humans and sharks interacting,” Metzger said. “If you see a lot of activity, get out of the water.”\\n\\n        \\n            Tue 26 Jul 2022 14.32\\xa0BST\\n\\n\\n            Last modified on Tue 26 Jul 2022 15.05\\xa0BST\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  \"Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership contest, has been giving an interview for Sky News during a campaign event in Sussex. Judging by what she said about Rishi Sunak’s tax policies, any hope that the campaign rhetoric may be softening is for the birds. Here are the main points.Let’s be clear, [Sunak’s] plan is to raise taxes. He is planning to raise taxes on corporations, putting our taxes up to the same level as France. That is going to put off people who want to invest in Britain. And I know there are masses of opportunities right across the country.Less investment will mean fewer jobs, fewer opportunities, lower wages and lower productivity in the future. So it’s cutting off our nose to spite our face. The fact is that we promised in our manifesto not to raise national insurance. I thought it was wrong at the time to do so, and that is why I would reverse that.I also want to put money into people’s pockets. I could quote the OECD who said that our current policy is contractionary. And what that means is it will lead to a recession. A recession would be a disaster, it would be a disaster for people who are homeowners. It would be a disaster for people who go out to work. It would be a disaster for people who run businesses.That is why I want to keep taxes low, attract the investment, get the growth. That’s the best way to pay down our debt.I don’t base my policies on the number of economists... The question is who is right.The fact is we are one of the few G7 countries that are putting up taxes.Countries like the United States, Canada, Japan have higher levels of debt than us.They are not putting up taxes because they understand that now is the time we need to get the economic growth into our economy to avoid a recession and to make sure that we are attracting business investment and those jobs and growth for the future.I don’t take any notice of these bellicose threats. I’m on the side of the travelling public who need to get into work to do their jobs.Here are answers to some of the questions people have submitted through our experimental widget.Truss and Sunak’s spending plansAm I correct in thinking that neither candidate for PM have said anything about their spending priorities, let alone how that reconcile their proposed tax cuts with the increasing demand to provide even basic government services?They have talked about spending plans a bit - but mainly to promise extra spending (on defence, for example, or for the Border Force). The IFS says Truss’s plans would almost certainly have to involve cuts in public spending but - beyond a hint from one of her supporters that existing government spending plans are not set in stone - she has not addressed this point properly at all. If you want a list of all their polices, Public First has a good tracker here.What will happen to the loser?Hi Andrew, SJ here. I thought it was interesting that both Liz and Rishi said they would offer one another cabinet positions. I struggle to imagine a world though, where either of them would offer one of the big offices of state and it is also difficult to believe they would accept a less-prestigious cabinet position. What do you see being the most likely scenario with the losing candidate? Cabinet position? Backbench grandee? Or even leaving politics altogether (more likely in Rishi’s case than with Liz). Thanks!The normal procedure in these circumstances is to offer a rival such a junior post that they feel obliged to return to the backbenches. This is what Boris Johnson did in 2019, when he offered Jeremy Hunt demotion from foreign secretary to defence secretary. Hunt said no. But given that the two candidates disagree so fundamentally on the economy, the winner might not even bother and might just exclude the other one from their government altogether. It may also depend on the size of the victory margin. After winning 65%/35%, Truss would feel much more confident despatching Sunak to the wilderness than after a 55%/45% victory.How will the winner move on?How will the winning candidate for PM manage to unite the Tory Party once they have won? How will the new PM be able to then switch to a more moderate tone to try and win the next election ?More easily than you think. At the moment Truss is making a lot of rightwing announcements because she needs to win over a rightwing audience. Once the focus changes (assuming she wins - but the same principle would be true for Sunak), and she needs to focus on the parliamentary party and the electorate at large, she will change her tone. (It is not as if she hasn’t had any practice.)Number of debatesHi Andrew all these debates in the Tory leadership contest seem to be complete overkill especially since most people have no vote. It also seems that there are more of these debates than for previous such contests - is this correct? Where there any for the 2020 Labour leadership contest?I haven’t done a count, but I think we are getting at least as many debates and hustings as in 2019. It is just that you have forgotten most of them because quite quickly they become very repetitive. And there were plenty of Labour events in early 2020 too, until Covid closed them down.Privileges committeeHi Andrew - how likely is it that the Privileges Committee find Boris Johnson has broken the ministerial code, and that he is subsequently is suspended and faces a recall petition? And how likely is it, in addition, that he is recalled and faces a byelection?| The committee is not specifically investigating whether Johnson broke the ministerial code - a matter for government, not parliament - but if it were to find that Johnson did deliberately mislead parliament, that would amount to a finding that the ministerial code had been broken.I think it is already clear that the committee will conclude that MPs were misled by what Johnson said, and that this amounts to a contempt of parliament. Johnson has admitted himself that he passed on duff information. Whether or not they conclude he lied is less clear. They will want a conclusion that the committee supports unanimously, and that is likely to be accepted by the Commons as a whole, and so they may find it hard to justify a conclusion saying bluntly: “He lied.” But they might; they seem very serious about gathering evidence. At the very least I expect the committee to say Johnson was cavalier about MPs being misled, and that this was unaccepable.Will they recommend a suspension of at least 10 days (which could trigger recall)? I don’t know. But any punishment would have to be put to the Commons for a vote, and I think Harriet Harman will want a report that receives widespread backing from MPs, not a split along party lines.If Johnson does get suspended for 10 days, campaigners would have to get 10% of voters in his constituency to sign a petition for a recall election to take place. I guess that would be easily done.One other possibility - the new prime minister could ask MPs to vote to halt the privileges committee inquiry. That would be hugely controversial, because it would be another example of Tory MPs voting to protect one of their own. But Liz Truss may feel that a row about that is preferrable to six months’ of stories about the former party leader being a liar. It would be the equivalent of Gerald Ford granting Richard Nixon a pardon in 1976.Scottish independenceHi Andrew, do you think a Conservative or Labour government will ever allow a second Scottish Independence Referendum? If so, under what circumstances do you think they would concede one?||||If not, does that present a constitutional crisis since the power technically exists to hold one, but it’s being withheld regardless of the case for it?It is definitely possible at some point in the future. Note, for example, how Rishi Sunak is saying today that a second referendum is “the wrong priority at the worst possible moment” - not that it should never happen. But 2030 the argument that the 2014 was meant to settle matters for a generation will not have much grip. And if public support for independence in Scotland were to start regularly reaching 55/60%, then at that point I think Westminster would have to respond.Race and the leadership contestWhy is the issue of race not being mentioned? Everyone knows that there is a core of the Tory membership that will never vote for a non-white individual as their leader. Sunak is too weak to challenge such individuals and Truss seems content to simply hoover up the votes of such individuals. The Rwanda policy, which even Tom Tugendhat supports, shows how anti-foreigner views are being chased after and not confronted. You’re right. There has been little media discussion of whether Sunak not being white is a problem for his chances. But mostly, I think, that reflects a media consensus that race is not a significant factor at all in the contest (and that going on about it might actually reinforce prejudice). The Conservative party has changed enormously over the past decade, and the line-up in the early stages of the contest - which was easily the most diverse of any leadership contest for any major party in UK history - ought to show that ethnicity does not stop people succeeding right at the top of politics anymore.It is also the case that it is impossible to tell whether ethnicity affects people’s chances of getting elected in a contest like this. There is some evidence for the impact it has in a general election, and that does show that Conservative-leaning voters are slightly less inclined to vote for a non-white candidate. But the impact is marginal (and not enough to make one think it would be a decisive factor in the Truss v Sunak contest). This is what the evidence says according to The British General Election of 2019, the definitive study of the contest.As at other recent elections, felding [an ethnic minority] candidate appears to have made a difference to the vote secured by Conservative candidates, but not by their Labour counterparts. Where the Conservatives felded an ethnic minority candidate in 2019 after not having done so in 2017, their vote fell on average by −1.2 points. In contrast, Conservative support increased by +2.1 points where either a white candidate or an ethnic minority candidate was felded on both occasions. This discrepancy cannot be accounted for by the incumbency status of the candidate or the ethnic composition of the constituency, while it is apparent in both Leave and Remain seats. What is more, where the Conservative candidate in 2019 was white but the previous candidate was from a minority background in 2017, the average rise in the Conservative vote was, at +2.8 points, a little higher than elsewhere. The relatively socially conservative character of Conservative support still appears to be refected in a reluctance by a few of the party’s potential voters to back a more ethnically diverse parliamentary party.Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership contest, has been giving an interview for Sky News during a campaign event in Sussex. Judging by what she said about Rishi Sunak’s tax policies, any hope that the campaign rhetoric may be softening is for the birds. Here are the main points.Let’s be clear, [Sunak’s] plan is to raise taxes. He is planning to raise taxes on corporations, putting our taxes up to the same level as France.

My colleague Larry Elliott has the details here.Overnight Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and favourite in the Tory leadership contest, announced plans that she said would “prevent trade unions from paralysing the country”. They would significantly curtail the ability of trade unions to use strike action as a means of protecting their members’ interests.According to her news release, she would:As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports in her story on this, Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT, has said the proposals would amount to “the biggest attack on trade union and civil rights since labour unions were legalised in 1871”. He said unions would fight them with mass resistance.Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, has this afternoon released a similar statement, saying Truss will be met by “fierce, prolonged resistance” if she tries to push through these changes. Graham said:Let’s be clear Liz Truss’s madcap proposals are an attempt to outlaw strike action and effective trade unions.This so-called manifesto is a declaration of war on the trade union movement and working people. In effect, it is a charter for massive social discontent.What we have here is an ambitious politician, hawking for the votes of a tiny minority by putting the rights of all workers on the chopping block.At the time of a cost of living crisis, where profiteering not wages is driving inflation, this would-be prime minister has instead chosen to return Britain’s workplaces to the 19th century. It’s Charles Dickens meets 2022.Unite will not bow to threats and bullying and any attempt to make our fight for jobs, pay and conditions illegal will be met with fierce, prolonged resistance.Labour says Boris Johnson’s account of his meeting with the former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev (see 2.19pm) suggests he has “something to hide”. This is from Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader.Boris Johnson has finally admitted to meeting a former KGB agent while Foreign Secretary in the wake of an attack on British soil and after a crucial NATO summit but this mealy-mouthed statement raises more questions than it answers.Keeping the British people safe should be a priority of government, but this web of murky relationships shows the Conservatives cannot be trusted with our national security ...This letter suggests the prime minister has something to hide. He has failed to answer whether a private phone call with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had been arranged or explain the presence of an undeclared and unidentified guest.As foreign secretary, Boris Johnson’s carelessness with words put people in danger. Every day he clings to office, there is new evidence of the risk to national security he poses.You will notice a new feature on the blog: a panel allowing you to ping a question or a comment directly to me. This is something that we are experimenting with because, although I normally monitor the comments posted below the line for questions addressed to me directly (by searching for people who address them to Andrew), invariably some of those get missed. Hearing from readers and responding to points they raise has always been an important feature of this blog, and one that makes the journalism better, and so we are trying this feature just to see if it works better. Boris Johnson has given his fullest public account to date of how he met the former KGB agent and Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev at a private party in Italy in April 2018, when Johnson was foreign secretary. The party was hosted by Lebedev’s son, Evgeny Lebedev, a friend of Johnson’s who has subsequently been given a peerage.Johnson attended the event without the security detail that normally accompanied him as foreign secretary and, although his presence at the event with Alexander Lebedev was first reported in 2019, questions have persisted about what Johnson was up to, and whether it was appropriate. Recently Paul Caruana Galizia from Tortoise reported that Lebedev had arranged for Johnson to take a call from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, while he was at the party, without government officials monitoring it, but that the call never happened – purportedly because Johnson overslept.Scoop: in April 2018, Alexander Lebedev set up an unmonitored line between Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, and Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, to discuss the Salisbury poisonings.But the call never happened because... https://t.co/RXDih3ZcrJAt a hearing with the Commons liaison committee earlier this month, Johnson admitted for the first time that he had met Alexander Lebedev at the party. The committee had various follow-up questions and, in a letter to it released today, Johnson has addressed them. Here are the key points.Officials were aware in advance that I was attending the social event. Contrary to some reports, my visit was in line with established security protocols under successive foreign secretaries. It would not have been normal practice for civil servants or security staff to have accompanied me to such a private, social occasion. I did not take ministerial papers with me.On the Saturday night, Johnson is understood to have got heavily drunk at the event, meaning that it was unlikely that much of substance was discussed between the newspaper owner and the then foreign secretary.

In a response to Sunak’s column in the Scottish Daily Mail (see 10.56am), Kirsten Oswald, the party’s deputy leader at Westminster, said:Rishi Sunak’s warped logic appears to be that the people of Scotland cannot be given a say over their constitutional future because the UK is in such a mess. It is precisely because the UK is lagging behind neighbouring countries on a range of wealth and equality indicators – as demonstrated in the recent Scottish government paper  – that independence for Scotland is essential. The longer Scotland remains tied to a failing Westminster system, the poorer we will become as a result. The Tories put the exact case that Rishi Sunak is making to the people of Scotland at every election, and they lose every election by a landslide. It’s clear that neither of the Tory candidates have put any thought into their Scotland strategy, which does not bode well for either of them becoming prime minister.Hi. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Rachel Hall. I’ll be here for the rest of the day, including covering the Talk TV/Sun Tory leadership debate at 6pm.And talking of debates, here is more on the YouGov poll of Tory members who watched last night’s BBC debate. The results are good for Liz Truss - in fact, so good for her that (unless the Tory members being sampled by YouGov are seriously unrepresentative of the acting voting membership, which seems unlikely) it is increasingly hard to see how Rishi Sunak wins.Our snap poll of 507 Tory party members who watched last night's BBC debate shows that Truss is seen as having performed bestLiz Truss: 50%Rishi Sunak: 39%https://t.co/UHictqetge pic.twitter.com/nIOyvrS5RFTruss came across as more in touch and trustworthy in the debate, according to Tory membersIn touch with ordinary peopleTruss 63% / Sunak 19%LikeableTruss 54% / Sunak 35%TrustworthyTruss 51% / Sunak 37%Prime MinisterialTruss 42% / Sunak 43%https://t.co/UHictqetge pic.twitter.com/eTfjC7HBwvAlthough debates can change perceptions of a candidate, more often they don’t, and more often debating polling just reflects what people thought of the candidates before the debate took place. In broad terms, that seems to be the case with this poll. Last week a YouGov poll of Tory members had Truss leading Sunak by 62% to 38%. Today’s poll results suggest Sunak may have outperformed the baseline - ie, he scored better than expected given that the audience (Tory members) favoured Truss in the first place - but not by enough to overcome his initial handicap.The UK has imposed sanctions on Sarvar and Sanjar Ismailov, nephews of Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who has close ties to the Kremlin.Sarvar Ismailov was previously a director at Everton Football Club and both have significant interests in the UK, the Foreign Office said.The leaders of the Moscow-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine have also been hit with sanctions.Foreign secretary Liz Truss said:  We will not keep quiet and watch Kremlin-appointed state actors suppress the people of Ukraine or the freedoms of their own people.We will continue to impose harsh sanctions on those who are trying to legitimise [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion until Ukraine prevails.A British wine wholesaler who last year criticised Brexit as the biggest threat to his business in 30 years has decided to leave the UK after post-Brexit paperwork made a £150,000 hole in revenue.Daniel Lambert, who supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and 300 independent retailers, is moving to Montpellier in France later this week with his wife and two teenage children.There he will set up a French company to export back to his own company in Wales.He said the only way he could get around the “incredibly complicated” paperwork for importing alcohol was to establish a French company to export into the UK, and do the administration in the EU himself.“I am doing what the government was suggesting, which is to have a company here and in Europe to mitigate the impact of Brexit,” he said. “What I’m doing will enable me to import and export into and out of the EU within the company itself, so that we mitigate all of the cost of importing into the UK.” Daniel Lambert Wines imports more than 2m bottles of wine a year. Business boomed during the pandemic, with revenues up by about £500,000 as locked down consumers substituted visits to the pub with home supplies.But the end of the Brexit transition agreement in January ate into any profits, with red tape costing the company “between £100,000 and £150,000”, Lambert said.His Twitter posts about the Brexit regulations have a brisk following among fellow businesses, as he was one of the earliest to come to terms with the 200 pages of paperwork per consignment.“In just one week I will finally leave Brexitland for good. Let me know if anyone ever finds those sunlit uplands. Not expecting an answer anytime soon,” he posted last week.In just one week I will finally leave Brexitland for good. Let me know if anyone ever finds those sunlit uplands. Not expecting an answer anytime soon.Before Brexit, transporting wine across the Channel was relatively straightforward. After Brexit, it has turned into a nightmare with hauliers fleeing the sector because of the complexity of the additional paperwork. All goods imported must be accompanied by paperwork detailing a commodity code and other information such as origin and destination of the cargo.Wine imports require specialist expertise. For a start, each type of wine has an individual commodity code depending on the variety of grape, the type of wine, the alcohol strength, the size of the container it is being imported in and whether it comes from a protected designation of origin.According to the government website there are 361 different commodities in the wine category alone. A pallet is made up of different wine cases, with each one attracting additional charges.Lambert said this had proved a massive deterrent for logistics firms with the number of hauliers now prepared to transport alcohol down from “hundreds” to just “four or five”, allowing brokers to charge up to £400 for each consignment.“The premiums that are now being paid to move alcohol, particularly across the border, are quite incredible. Brokers have found themselves doing pretty much what they like in terms of charging, because so few are willing to do it,” he said.By setting up a company in France, Lambert will be able to obtain a French economic operators registration (EORI) number required to export into Britain in addition to the UK EORI he retains in his British company for importing.For Lambert, it is complicated but the only post-Brexit way of continuing to trade in Britain as it will enable him legally to export and import while cutting out the middle agent charging up to £150,000 a year for paperwork.“It is absolutely incredible that in the 21st century people are being, in effect, barred from importing from Europe unless they pay brokers lots of money,” he said.He described the UK government’s claims that Brexit was done as “fatuous”, as many small- to medium-sized businesses could not cope with trade barriers that now exist for anyone trading with Europe.You’re going to need to move quickly once you’ve declared yourself a candidate in the leadership race. The first round of voting will take place less than a week after the prime minister has resigned and you don’t want to find yourself caught on the hop. Best to have a domain name and website material fully prepared. Readyforrishi.com, since reborn as ready4rishi.com, was registered back in December last year. That may have been a little too early. It’s hard to claim – though that didn’t stop Rish! – you have been taken aback by events and only recently decided to stand when you’ve been waiting for the day for more than six months. Everyone knows you’ve been desperate for the top job, but it’s bad form to look too eager. Optics are everything.Statement of the obvious, but you can’t have a leadership contest until the previous prime minister has resigned. This proved problematic with Boris Johnson as he is so narcissistic and corrupt that he refused to stand down long after most normal people would have realised the game was up. Once the leadership contenders realised there was no chance of Johnson resigning of his own volition, it became a game of cat and mouse to see who would move first against him. The downside of forcing him out was that you risked looking disloyal; the upside was that you could set the agenda and look like you have a few moral principles. Not always an advantage in the Tory party. In the event Sajid Javid and Rish! did the dirty by resigning within 10 minutes of each other on the evening of 5 July. They tried to claim their resignations were not coordinated but it seemed odd they should both have resignation letters prepared. Rish! claimed he was resigning over a disagreement on economic policy, presumably over Johnson’s planned tax cuts. Which rather suggested he was completely fine with Johnson being a serial liar over Partygate and ignoring repeated allegations that the deputy chief whip was a sex pest. Still, we all have our breaking point.It was almost certainly no coincidence that Liz Truss, Rish!’s main rival, was away at a G20 foreign minister’s meeting in Indonesia when he handed in his resignation letter, thereby giving him at least two days’ advantage over her. Truss flew straight back from Indonesia without any of the other G19 ministers noticing she wasn’t there. That’s Global Britain for you. Luckily for Liz, Johnson still managed to hang on for a couple of days, even with more than 50 ministers resigning, so her own leadership campaign wasn’t too inconvenienced. And she could legitimately claim she was the continuity candidate and had nothing to do with the coup against Johnson.For the laughs, if nothing else. No one could tell whether Penny Mordaunt’s was a joke or intended to be taken seriously. Against a soundtrack of I Vow to Thee, My Country and a Little Britain voiceover, Mordaunt’s team took us on a trip around Englishness. That included the murderer Oscar Pistorius, and the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox. Rish! chose tell us a story and merely put us to sleep. Truss took us on her on a whirlwind tour of her Instagram account as she posed with other politicians in front of ever larger union flags. Grant Shapps kept it short and sweet. He had no message other than to MPs: he would say anything to make them electable. Though, sadly, he was unable to make himself electable. Tom Tugendhat just promised to be the opposite of Johnson, which was the kiss of death to his campaign. Nadhim Zahawi said he would release his tax returns – but only the ones he had yet to complete. No one knew what was in Suella Braverman’s as no one saw it.Grant Shapps and Rehman Chishti never even got round to having a campaign launch before their leadership bids evaporated – a loss to satire if no one else. In 2019, even Matt Hancock and Mark Harper had some kind of do. At Door Matt’s we were all given free phone chargers as campaign merch; appropriately enough, they didn’t work. Harper had just nine people in the room, four of whom were sketchwriters. It was unclear whether Zahawi and Braverman actually had a launch as they were merely given five minute speaking slots at the launch of a rightwing Tory pressure group, ConservativesWay Forward. Or Backward, more like. A woman fainted during Zahawi’s slot. The chancellor for the next few weeks pretended not to notice and just kept on talking. Awks.Javid and Mordaunt both booked a small airless private dining room in Westminster. Javid was pouring with sweat before he had even begun speaking. Not the strongest selling point for the start of a campaign. Still, he did hand out free ice-creams at the end, so all was forgiven. Rish! was in a room in the Queen Elizabeth II conference hall that had plenty of spare spaces, mainly because he had barred several members of the media – including me. Tugendhat booked a four-storey atrium in Millbank and missed a golden opportunity to enter by abseiling from the ceiling. Did he mention that he had been in the army? Truss was the only one to hire a room with fully functioning air con. Unfortunately, she had forgotten where the door was. She struggled to find her way in and tried to leave via the first-floor window. Her event had been dismal. But not that dismal.Back in 2016, during the leadership contest that gave us Theresa May as PM, Andrea Leadsom had organised an event at which she was going to make a big speech on the economy. She didn’t mention the economy once. Instead, at the end, she announced she was going to march on Westminster. So a handful of MPs, Tim Loughton and Theresa Villiers among them, walked the 300 yards to parliament shouting: “Who do we want? Andrea Leadsom. When do we want her? Some time in September!” accompanied by me and a few other hacks who couldn’t believe our luck. Once we got to parliament, everyone hung around looking a bit embarrassed before they realised they had no idea what they were doing there and dispersed. Within days, Leadsom had withdrawn from the race, to make May leader by default.Under the rules of the 1922 Committee, all candidates had to get 20 nominations from Tory MPs to be allowed on to the first round of voting. Neither Shapps nor Javid could even manage that and had to gracefully withdraw from the contest. It was not clear whether Chishti ever had more than one nomination – himself. “I’d like to introduce the next leader of the Tory party. Me.” Weirdly, Hunt made it through to the first ballot, where 30 votes were needed to progress, only to get 18 – fewer than he had got the day before. Must have been something he said. Zahawi also went out in the first round proper.It’s considered bad form to rubbish your leadership rivals. That’s why – if you’re lucky – you have a small army of prominent Tory MPs and other supporters who will do it for you. For a long while Truss was running third in the contest, with her biggest rival for the second qualifying spot, Mordaunt, above her. At which point Team Liz went for Mordaunt, while Truss pretended it was nothing to do with her. David Frost even had the cheek to claim that Mordaunt was a bit lazy and had never been up to the job. This from a man who hadn’t realised he had negotiated the Northern Ireland protocol he was now trying to unpick because the EU had decided to implement it. Truss also got help from Kemi Badenoch’s team. Badenoch had never expected to make the last two and, with the help of Michael Gove, her main man, was trying to raise her profile and secure a future cabinet job. So Badenoch undermining Mordaunt for being too woke won’t have done her any harm at all.The last five candidates – Rish!, Truss, Mordaunt, Badenoch and Tugendhat – made it to the weekend of the first three televised debates. The first two were inconclusive affairs, with only Tugendhat being brave enough to say Johnson was totally dishonest. The others played safe, with the main action being blue-on-blue action between Rish! and Truss. The two frontrunners quickly realised they were harming their chances and that the more the public saw of Badenoch, Mordaunt and Tugendhat, the more they liked them. So they both refused to take part in the scheduled Sky debate. So it was cancelled. You can have too much democracy at times like these.Four of the final six candidates dropped out of the race pretty much in the order that people expected: Braverman first, then Tugendhat, Badenoch and Mordaunt. But that didn’t discourage rival camps from dropping hints that they might lend votes to opponents to make sure key rivals were knocked out. Gavin Williamson, who prides himself on being an arch-manipulator and helped run Ready4Rish!, would love you to believe he was responsible for votes switching hands in this way, though given his general levels of effectiveness, he probably wasn’t. Even so, by voting Rish! and Truss through to the last two, the Tory MPs have done their utmost to ensure their party loses the next election. At least that’s what several Team Penny MPs suggested to me. So well done them.Now we’re down to the last two. The electorate that matters has switched from 358 Tory MPs to about 160,000 Conservative members. So Truss no longer has to feel ashamed of having Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg on her side, because they are as batshit mad as the members. Remember, these people would almost certainly vote Johnson back in as prime minister, even though his MPs and the rest of the country no longer believe a word he says. Here, Truss has a huge advantage because she can legitimately say she was happy for the serial liar to remain in office. Meanwhile, both Rish! and Truss can compete with each other to be the most rightwing contestant. “I’m going to send more refugees to Rwanda than you!” and “I’m tougher on China than you.” Something that no one but the Tory members really cares about.It is now totally legitimate for both Rish! and Truss to forget they have both been in government, Sunak as chancellor, Truss as foreign secretary, for years and that they and the Tories are responsible for the mess the UK is in. Both are ready to declare a state of national emergency as they promise to undo the madness and solve the cost of living crisis. They are both going to get a hell of a shock when they find out who has been running things for the past 12 years. There are differences between them, though. Sunak says things are a disaster but it would be even more disastrous if he were to do anything to change that. Truss says the answer is unfunded tax cuts of £34bn. She knows this because Patrick Minford, the economist who got every prediction on Brexit wrong, has told her it’s OK. Phew!It’s also now fine to reinvent your own past. Truss has been on a journey from a middle-class background in Leeds, where she went to the city’s best comprehensive school and went on to do PPE at Oxford, to a life of grinding working-class poverty. Sunak has been on a similar adventure. He and his family were down to their last Valium in their local pharmacy when he happened to go to Winchester and on to Oxford where he studied PPE. Fancy that! A choice of two PPE graduates. Such diversity. Rish! can scarcely bring himself to revisit the struggle he faced to amass a family net worth of £800m. But he feels our pain.There’s nothing the Tory members like more than a lazy Maggie stereotype. So Truss has wasted no opportunity to dress up like her for the televised debates and other media appearances. Rish! has had to settle for merely making a pilgrimage to Grantham, where he sobbed at Thatcher’s birthplace before insisting that his economic model was the one she would have admired. The idea that either of them might have policies of their own and that it was time to move on from 80s Maggie nostalgia porn doesn’t seem to have occurred to them.Until 5 September, when the new leader will be announced. At the end of the second televised debate Rish! asked Truss why they were being so beastly to one another. That sentiment didn’t last long. Since they both reached the final two, they have spent most of their time attacking each other over everything from wearing the wrong clothes to having the wrong policies. Monday night’s head-to-head debate was probably a low point as Rish! and Truss chose to spend the hour trading insults and ignorance over tax and the climate emergency. Rish! was especially keen on mansplaining over his rival, though both gave the impression they would happily see the country on its knees and let the planet burn in exchange for 24 hours in Downing Street. Each accused the other of being a dangerous halfwit. The worry for the country is that they are both right. Lucky us.Rape and domestic violence cases will be fast-tracked through the courts under a Labour government so that no victim has to wait more than a year for justice, Keir Starmer has pledged.In an interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader said Boris Johnson had made no progress tackling gender-based violence during his premiership because of his “appalling” attitude towards women.Talking on a visit to Liverpool, Starmer blamed the government for so few rape cases leading to charges. Analysis by the Guardian last year found that while there were 52,210 rapes recorded by police in England and Wales in 2020, only 843 resulted in a charge or a summons – a rate of 1.6%.The former director of public prosecutions (DPP) said he initially could not believe the statistics, and asked his team to double-check them. “1.6% is staggeringly bad. And it’s an indictment on the government that the percentage is where it is.”The most recent figures from the Crown Prosecution Service show that while there was a 63% increase in the volume of rape prosecutions from 1,557 in 2020-21 to 2,537 in 2021-2022, the conviction rate dropped from 71% to 69%.Victims are also waiting longer for justice after half of all courts were shut by successive Conservative-led governments since 2010, with additional cuts to the number of days judges can sit on trials.Asked what he would do to tackle the backlog, Starmer said: “Possibly we could do more sitting days. But I think realistically, we’ve just got to fast-track certain cases to say: these have to take priority. Now, that’s always a difficult decision, because there are other cases in the system. But I think it’s the only way to drive these cases through. Nobody who’s been subjected to sexual or domestic violence should be waiting a year or more for their case to come to court. What will happen [otherwise] – what always happens – is that people fall away on that journey, because it’s just too long. It’s too hard to endure, and they never get the justice that they deserve.”Starmer said he wanted to see an expansion of sexual assault referral clinics and workplace referral schemes for domestic violence. “You shouldn’t have to go to a police station to report what’s happened to you,” he said.Domestic abuse cases have risen sharply in recent years. Serena Kennedy, the chief constable of Merseyside police, told Starmer that since 1 April her force had recorded 5,434 crimes flagged as domestic abuse, up 23% from from 4,402 in the same quarter of 2020.Starmer said that there had been “frustratingly slow process” since he stepped down as DPP in 2013. Politicians needed to listen to survivors who had been through the criminal justice system, most of whom concluded that “I wouldn’t do that again”, he said.At a roundtable discussion with experts involved in tackling violence against women in Merseyside, Starmer supported a proposal to “flip” the status quo on who has to leave the family home after an incident of domestic violence.Catherine Murray-Howard, the chief operating officer of the Torus housing association, criticised the current government strategies, which she said were overly focused on safe alternative accommodation for women rather than enabling them to stay at home with their children and their abuser being forced out.“That government message for me is: why does it have to be the victim or survivor who has to change their life, and face that huge upheaval?” said Murray-Howard.Johnson was unable to make “material change” in tackling violence against women and girls because of his own attitude towards women, said Starmer. “Not only his general attitude to women, but the dismissive nature in which he dealt with women standing up in the chamber.”He recalled how Johnson belittled Paula Sherriff – then the Labour MP for Dewsbury, and a good friend of Jo Cox, who was murdered in neighbouring Batley and Spen – when she asked him to stop calling his opponents “traitors”, because it led to death threats. “I have to say, Mr Speaker, I’ve never heard such humbug in all my life,” said Johnson.“His behaviour to her was appalling,” said Starmer, also criticising the prime minister for promoting Chris Pincher to deputy chief whip despite knowing that he had a reputation as a sexual predator. “Sexual and domestic violence is about power. And he gave power to a man who we knew was a sexual predator. And then he went on to commit further like behaviours. So there is no way that Boris Johnson could have possibly brought around the change that we need.”Boris Johnson has told MPs that no government business was discussed “as far as I am aware” when he met the former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev at an Italian palazzo without officials present when he was foreign secretary.The prime minister admitted this month that he met the businessman in April 2018 after making a trip to a restored castle in Perugia owned by Evgeny Lebedev, Alexander’s son, for a weekend-long party after attending a Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels that discussed the security situation with Russia.Writing back to provide further detail in response to questions posed to him by MPs on the Commons liaison committee on 6 July, he stated that officials were aware in advance he was attending what he described as a social event, and that he did not take ministerial papers with him.The visit was in line with established security protocols, he said, adding that it would not have been normal practice for civil servants or security officials to accompany him to “such a private, social occasion”.In a letter released by the committee on Tuesday, Johnson wrote: “If a minister meets an external organisation or individual and finds themselves discussing official business without an official present – for example at a social occasion – any significant context should be passed back to the department after the event. That was not necessary in this case. As far as I am aware, no government business was discussed.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said Johnson’s “mealy-mouthed statement” raised more questions than it answered and that his “carelessness with words” had put people in danger while he was foreign secretary.“Keeping the British people safe should be a priority of government, but this web of murky relationships shows the Conservatives cannot be trusted with our national security,” she said. “The prime minister claims the meeting wasn’t pre-arranged and yet also says officials had been made aware in advance, but he apparently still can’t recall whether he discussed government business or not.”Johnson said in his letter that there had been “considerable engagement” in the past between senior Labour MPs and Evgeny Lebedev, which included attendance at his social events.Johnson admitted to the meeting for the first time while responding to questions from Labour’s Meg Hillier at the committee earlier this month. When pressed over whether he had reported it to Foreign Office officials, he said: “I think I did mention it, yes.”A record of the trip was initially disclosed by him in the register of members’ interests, which recorded that he had an “overnight stay” with Evgeny Lebedev on Saturday 28 April 2018, travelling “accompanied by a spouse, family member or friend”.A picture emerged of Johnson at a nearby airport in Italy. Other passengers said the then foreign secretary looked like he had “slept in his clothes”, struggled to walk in a straight line and said he had had a heavy night.Separately in the same correspondence, Johnson revealed that an investigation into the Commons leader, Mark Spencer, over allegations of Islamophobia was in limbo as it had not been completed before his former ethics adviser Christopher Geidt quit the role.Lord Geidt was examining claims by the MP and former minister Nus Ghani, who alleged in January that when she lost her job as a transport minister she was told that her “Muslimness” had been raised as a problem at a meeting in Downing Street. Spencer voluntarily identified himself as the person Ghani had made the claims about, and said they were “completely false” and defamatory.“The investigation therefore remains outstanding and should be a matter for a new independent adviser function, as soon as appointed by my successor,” Johnson wrote to the committee, which considers the overall work of select committees and promotes effective scrutiny of the government.\"),\n",

       "  'Instagram’s head defended the app against a user backlash, after the social network launched a series of changes intended to make it more like its arch-rival TikTok.The changes, which include an extremely algorithmic main feed, a push for the service’s TikTok-style “reels” videos, and heavy promotion of the TikTok-style “remix” feature, have resulted in users struggling to find content from friends and family, once the bread and butter of the social network.“We’re hearing a lot of concerns from all of you,” Adam Mosseri said in a video posted to Twitter. “I’m hearing a lot of concerns about photos, and how we’re shifting to video. We’re going to continue to support photos, but I need to be honest: more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time. We’re going to have to lean in to that shift while continuing to support photos.”The Instagram boss also defended the platform’s new “recommendations” feature, which puts content from people users do not follow on to their feed.“The idea is to help you discover new and interesting things on Instagram that you might not even know exist,” he said. “You can snooze all recommendations for up to a month, but we’re going to try and get better at recommendations because we think it’s one of the best ways to help creators reach a new audience and grow their following.He added: “We’re going to need to evolve, because the world is changing quickly and we’re going to need to change with it.”The backlash against the changes was typified by Kylie Jenner, a member of the Kardashian clan and social media power user, who posted a widely shared story on the site calling on the service to “make Instagram Instagram again”. Her post was re-shared by her older sister Kim Kardashian.Stop trying to be TikTok, I just want to see cute photos of my friends,” Jenner added, signing the post “sincerely, everyone”.The intervention may be lighthearted, but in the influencer world, Jenner means serious business. In 2018, a single tweet from the socialite asking “does anyone else not open Snapchat any more” wiped $1.3bn off the market cap of the social network, cementing the impression that a much-vaunted redesign had failed to land and forcing the company to backtrack a few weeks later.Instagram’s makeover is widely seen as a response to TikTok’s continued growth, in particular among younger American users. In the UK, Instagram remains the third most-visited social network, according to Ofcom stats from September 2021, but globally TikTok appears to lead, with more downloads than any other app, according to the analytics firm Sensor Tower.By boosting algorithmic recommendations, allowing users to “remix” posts (akin to TikTok’s “Duet” feature), and promoting full-screen vertical video above photos, Instagram is attempting to turn its main app experience into something similar to that of the Chinese-owned upstart.Its sister app, Facebook, is undergoing a similar rebirth. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg announced a revival of the “chronological feed” in the main Facebook app, alongside a newly algorithmic “home” tab, again an attempt to imitate TikTok’s popular “For you” page.“Our discovery engine will recommend the content we think you’ll care most about,” Zuckerberg said in a post announcing the change.Facebook is turning to its “supreme court” to decide whether to end restrictions on Covid misinformation, more than two years after the company first started to take special action on posts promoting falsehoods about the disease.The social network is considering changing the way it deals with such misinformation by, for example, labelling it as false or demoting it in algorithmic ranking, rather than simply removing it from the site. It wants to make the change now, according to head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, “as many, though not all, countries around the world seek to return to more normal life”.But in order to avoid making the wrong choice when “resolving the inherent tensions between free expression and safety”, Facebook will turn to its oversight board, the arms-length self-regulator set up in May 2020, to decide on what the future moderation policy should be.“We are requesting an advisory opinion from the oversight board on whether Meta’s current measures to address Covid-19 misinformation under our harmful health misinformation policy continue to be appropriate,” Clegg said, “or whether we should address this misinformation through other means, like labeling or demoting it either directly or through our third-party fact-checking program.”By requesting an opinion, Facebook is not committing to honour the judgment issued by the board, prompting some to question whether the site was simply seeking cover for making a decision likely to be broadly unpopular with a large section of society whatever it chooses.In a statement, the oversight board said it had accepted Facebook’s request. “Meta [Facebook’s parent company] must send the board’s recommendations through its official policy development process and give regular updates on this, including through its newsroom,” the board added.“While the board’s policy advisory opinion is not binding, Meta must provide a public response and follow-on actions within 60 days of receiving our recommendations.”In its detailed request for an option, Meta said that the increased availability of authoritative guidance means that misinformation is less likely to be posted into an “information vacuum”. It also argued that the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments, as well as the evolution of variants such as the Omicron strain, mean that Covid-19 is less deadly than it used to be, and said that “public health authorities are actively evaluating whether Covid-19 has evolved to a less severe state”.“Meta remains committed to combating Covid-19 misinformation and providing people with reliable information,” Clegg said in a statement. “As the pandemic has evolved, the time is right for us to seek input from the oversight board about our measures to address Covid-19 misinformation, including whether those introduced in the early days of an extraordinary global crisis remains the right approach for the months and years ahead.”The oversight board is funded by Facebook, and its first four members, all of whom hold the title co-chair, were selected by the social network. The co-chairs and Facebook picked the initial board of 20, which includes former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, and over time intend to expand it to a board of 40, at which point Facebook says it will cease to be involved in selecting membership. After more than two years, however, the board is still only 23 people.Despite the close links, the board has had some clashes with Facebook. In 2021, it rejected an attempt by the social network to force it to decide – and take the political fallout over – whether to permanently block Donald Trump from the site, and later that same year it also overruled Facebook’s attempt to prevent it from passing judgment on a particular case, in an assertion of its own authority likened by observers to the US supreme court’s historic 1803 ruling in Marbury v Madison.'),\n",

       "  'Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.comHow can I rev up a scoop of vanilla ice-cream?Joe, SalfordAccessorising ice-cream is often most successful when there’s an element of contrast, whether that’s a tart fruit puree (blackcurrant, say) for old-school ripple vibes, a handful of something crunchy (toasted sesame seeds, nuts, crumbled cookies) or a shattered magic chocolate shell (where you mix equal parts melted chocolate and coconut oil, pour it over your ice-cream, and watch it solidify). And, happily for you, Joe, this is very much vanilla-specific.“Among very few other contenders, my number-one dessert in the world is vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce,” says Jacob Kenedy, chef-patron of Gelupo in Soho, London. “Those two things together are nirvana.” The chocolate sauce, however, must be made the way his grandfather did: “Roughly half-and-half melted bitter chocolate and water, plus a tiny bit of sugar”. It’s also vital that the sauce is warm, not hot, so the ice-cream only “melts a little”. The idea of pouring other things over ice-cream is worth exploring too, he says, such as with affogato (the Italian tradition of tipping a double espresso over your vanilla). Or cracking open the drinks cupboard: “You can pour brandy or whisky over it; amaro is delicious; or coffee and a spirit.” Puddles galore await.“You can also combine fats,” adds Kenedy, throwing whipped cream into the arena – just don’t get carried away: “Add one or two things, no more,” Kennedy warns. “Either chocolate sauce and whipped cream, fruit (raspberries, strawberries, peaches, baked pears) and chocolate sauce, or fruit and toasted nuts.”Terri Mercieca, pastry chef and founder of cult ice-cream sandwich and soft-serve purveyor Happy Endings, often feels fruity, too: “I’m a big fan of passion fruit with vanilla ice-cream.” When in this mindset, she grabs a bowl, scoops in her vanilla, along with hazelnuts, chunks of caramel or good-quality chocolate, or freeze-dried fruits, and tops with passion fruit. You could use mango instead – or, Mercieca adds, “all the good fruit you get in summer”. One such fruit is cherries, which Diana Henry, in Simple: effortless food, big flavours, cooks in butter, sugar, lemon juice and grappa, before serving warm with ice-cream. And there’s nothing, er, vanilla about that.An emergency ice-cream sandwich fix is also mere moments away: take your favourite tub of vanilla and stick it between your favourite cookies. Job done. To build a better one, though, Mercieca has some pointers: “Turn a biscuit upside down, put a ring cutter on top and smoosh the ice-cream in there.” Remove the cutter, top with another biscuit, and eat straight away: “If you put it back in the freezer, the biscuits get too hard – that’s why we use really thin ones”. You could, of course, make your own biscuits, in which case chocolate chip or shortbread are the way to go.Ever the maverick, Mercieca has also been known to serve her scoop scattered with (potato) chipsticks (yes, you read that right). “Especially if you get the fancy Portuguese ones,” she explains. “With caramel sauce… Winning.” And who are we to disagree?Anna BerrillDo you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.comA quick pasta supper with summer vegetables and crème fraîche.Wash 200g of young spinach leaves. While the leaves are still wet, put them in a saucepan, cover tightly with a lid and let them cook over a moderate heat for a minute or two, just until the leaves are starting to wilt. Lift the lid and turn them over with kitchen tongs, then cook for a further minute till soft and emerald green.Immediately plunge the leaves into iced water, then squeeze out most of the water with your hands. Roughly chop and set aside.Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil. Salt it generously, then use it to cook 200g of bucatini, spaghetti or similar thin pasta till al dente.Peel and crush a clove of garlic. Cut a large courgette in half lengthways, then in half again and then into thin slices. Cook till translucent in a little olive oil in a shallow pan – about 10 minutes. Add the garlic. When the courgettes start to soften, after 4 or 5 minutes, and the garlic has turned pale gold remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.Wipe the pan, then add 200g of crème fraîche and warm gently over a moderate heat. Add 150g of frozen peas and then the chopped spinach.Drain the pasta, leaving 2 tbsp of cooking water behind with the pasta. Add the pasta and the reserved water to the vegetable sauce and toss gently then divide between 2 bowls. Serve with a little grated parmesan or pecorino and a lemon half for squeezing. Enough for 2. If you are using fresh peas, then cook them in a little boiling, lightly salted water before adding to the courgettes. As the young marrows come into season, this is a good way to use them. The skin is thicker than that of a courgette, so remove it with a vegetable peeler before slicing.Follow Nigel on Twitter @NigelSlaterMy partner and I have regular sex, which is great, but he always likes to be in control – and this means it is all about him and over very quickly.

I don’t want to upset him by saying the blatant truth – that this is unfulfilling for me. This has been going on for too long. I want a shared sex life, not one that’s just for him. Can you help me deal with this?Some people become very anxious about their expected role in helping a partner experience pleasure and orgasm, and perhaps your partner has become obstinate because he feels he cannot fulfil your needs. It may well be that he is simply selfish – but just accepting that will not you get what you want. Try to approach this problem from the point of view that perhaps he needs a different type of guidance from you, and is afraid of being a disappointment. Many women have found that taking responsibility for their own pleasure enhances mutual satisfaction. Try to find erotically based ways to increase your own pleasure during lovemaking. One technique involves stimulating yourself manually or with a sex toy during intercourse. Many partners find this extra arousing, and as a result they themselves become more willing to be guided into providing direct clitoral stimulation or whatever else is desired.

Their instructor calls the pose “the stranded fish”. The gulls and oystercatchers circling above them seem unconvinced. It’s 10am and the only other people on the beach are families, like us, with very young children – and who’ve been awake for ever. We recognise each others’ hollow eyes and raise our coffee cups in silent communion.Top: paddling in the pools. Above: youngsters queue for ice-creamsAn hour later, two Italian day-trippers from London place their towels on the sand and frown at the view. They were recommended Leigh-on-Sea as a great day at the seaside, and yet there is no actual sea – just mud. It’s low tide and great banks of pungent brown sludge stretch out into the distance, a vision interrupted only by the silos of industry on the far shore. Their eyes speak of a longing for the Mediterranean. Groups of older children happily slither through the pools of thick mud, laughing as their footsteps fart and slurp. It’s a shame that the day-trippers have already packed up and left when the transformation occurs. Over the course of a lunch hour, the little trickling creek cutting through the mud becomes a stream, becomes a river, and soon the mudflats have disappeared entirely beneath the greenish waters, the row of grounded sailboats now lifted and bobbing. That this all happens in perfect synchronicity with the clouds disappearing and the beach filling with people makes it feel like someone flipped a switch marked “summertime”.Teenagers leap off the wharf and plunge, screaming, into the water. A retired couple – down for the day from Billericay – pull up on their immaculate Harley-Davidson with the brushed copper detailing. They sit on the sea wall and eat trays of chips, each with an eyeball-sized pickled onion. A man intently watches his paddleboard inflate. The cockle shack’s queue keeps growing. Two friends – Alex and Nathan – promenade past the tea rooms with their tops off. All along the harbour front, the restaurants and pubs – The Crooked Billet, The Mayflower, The Peterboat – fill up and spill out on to the cobbles.Some members of the De Meo family on a big get-togetherOn the beach, Valerie De Meo is here with her three daughters, their partners and grandchildren. Since she and her family live in many different places – some in the US, some Norway, some, like her, in Essex – she’s glad of this rare chance to bring them together. We watch her grandkids eating takeaway pizzas in an inflatable dinghy on the sand. She looks at her eldest grandson in his camping chair and tells me that, in his hair and lips, she sees an echo of her husband who passed away 18 years ago. “It’s quite something,” she says, as her grandson looks up from his book, “how they live on in everyone.”Through the late afternoon, families head home and the atmosphere gets tasty. Four young men briefly park their growling BMWs on the slipway; each drinks a can of Monster. A teenage couple in Dr Martens and cardigans with elbow patches share a sly bottle of strawberry cider. One boy in swimming trunks locks his friend in the public toilets and finds it hilarious. A man drives past very slowly in a souped-up Ford Cortina with a Confederate flag on the dashboard.From top: setting up on the beach; Hazel, six, with a melting ice-cream; local lads Alex and Nathan; Devil Custom choppersUp on the hill above the beach, it’s quiet again. Margaret O’Connor is out in her front garden, zapping the weeds with a heat gun. She’s lived here 30 years but still thinks of herself as one of the “blow-ins” – a new arrival. It’s the fishermen who keep the town grounded, she says. She loves the tides and the seasons, watching the brent geese eat the eel grass on the mudflats. “They come in great flocks in the autumn, great clouds of them from Siberia and, at night, if the wind is right, you can hear them talking to each other.” That’s what she likes about the people in the town, too: everyone says hello. From up here on the hill, we watch the tide on its way out again, a sea becoming a river, a stream, a creek, a trickle – all the day’s footprints erased from the mud.An ice-cream sandcastle; traditional teatime treatsThe sand outside the windows stretches for miles. The sea is glinting in the distance and there are egrets standing guard along the estuary, their white feathers bright against caramel-gold sandbanks. “Could be the French Riviera. Look at it!” says one of my fellow passengers, waving his arm at the expansive views. His enthusiasm, partly fuelled by cans of morning cocktails, is not misplaced. The scenery gets better and better as winding saltmarsh gives way to the rising fells.Much of Cumbria has become too popular for its own good. But if you visit the overlooked coast and access the famous lakes without a car, you’ll find deserted beaches and unbeatable countryside without adding to the traffic. The swaying Avanti West Coast train from Euston to Lancaster takes just two-and-a-half hours to speed 250 miles while the leisurely Northern railway round the Cumbrian coast takes nearly as long again to cover less than half that distance. But this is a journey worth savouring. Each station and stretch of track has a distinct atmosphere, from the retro-romantic tea room at Carnforth, where 1945’s Brief Encounter was filmed, to the trackside Ratty Arms and flowerbeds at Ravenglass.I’ve been hoping for a reason to revisit Ravenglass since my last trip three years ago and now two new things to interest car-free travellers have come along at once: the free weekend shuttle bus to beautiful Wasdale this summer runs through from Ravenglass station in the morning and back in the evening (until 4 September). And new stretches of the England coast path around Cumbria have opened, which are easy to get to by rail, taking walkers through sand dunes and post-industrial nature reserves.Sam Bowden runs the Ravenglass Handmade Ice-Cream company with her family. They opened a new shop in June and the most popular flavour is sea buckthorn. There are inns nearby, next to the estuary, just minutes from the station, but this time I’m staying in the grounds of Muncaster Castle. Fuelled by rhubarb and ginger ice-cream, I hike a mile or so up through the woods to find the old granary, a converted barn that sleeps four. It’s part of the castle’s unpretentious Coachman’s Quarters. There are more self-catering rooms, including a dorm with four bunkbeds, across the courtyard with a communal kitchen and sitting room.The USP is after-hours access to Muncaster’s 77 acres of gardens. Paths climb through jungles of rhododendron and magnolias. There is a huge panorama from the mile-long terrace with its neat yew trees and borders full of tiger lilies. The view was once described by Victorian writer John Ruskin as the “gateway to Paradise”: the winding River Esk gleams blue and the fells flush scarlet in the setting sun.The logo for the Lake District national park is a stylised version of the view northwards along Wastwater towards fell-flanked Great Gable. Voted “favourite view” by an ITV poll in 2007, the valley often draws more than a quarter of a million visitors a year, causing queues of cars and campervans along the narrow scenic lanes of the Wasdale valley. The Wasdale shuttle aims to ease the weekend pressure and cut carbon emissions.The minibus stops to pick up a party of hikers from Cologne. “Weather like Italy and a free bus. What more could we wish for?” says Dirk Hertel. We all get off at the Wasdale Head Inn with rows of old climbers’ boots and ice axes over the mantelpiece. Tracks lead from here up Scafell and other mountains. The inn’s Victorian landlord, Will Ritson, famous for tall tales, gave his name to a nearby waterfall, Ritson’s Force.Previous Cumbrian walking holidays have often involved trudging through rain and warming up by pub fires. Today, I’m striding under blazing blue skies and cooling off in lakes and rivers. I cross a little stone bridge and climb past rosebay willowherb and the yellow starry flowers of bog asphodel. Ten minutes later, I’m floating in turquoise water under pine branches with the waterfall cascading into a pool above me. I head back down for a coffee at the Barn Door and set off along the valley on a steam-side path.The path along the screes on the far side of Wastwater looks far too much like hard work, but the little road I stick to instead is plagued by the traffic the Wasdale shuttle is trying to mitigate. Luckily, the bus can ferry walkers to the Greendale junction. Walk along the lakeside lane for half a mile until a path leads off through trees. I stop for another swim from a shingle beach under the branches: the water is bracing and the scenery spectacular.Scafell Pike, at 978m, is England’s highest mountain and Wastwater is England’s deepest lake. It’s this depth that keeps the water cool year-round and my feet start feeling icy after 10 minutes, so I crawl out and dry them on sun-warmed pebbles. Nether Wasdale has a choice of pubs and farm shop cafes, including the relatively new Sawmill. I have tea on its waterside terrace and half an amber ale called Errmmm… from the Strands microbrewery, before flagging the bus down outsideA friend is joining me for the second day’s walking. I meet her at the station and we have dinner at the village’s newly reopened Inn by the estuary in Ravenglass. The food and drink are exceptional: we eat charred mackerel with watercress, garden pea falafels with pickled beetroot, courgette fritters with feta, and drink fresh, not-too-sweet homemade elderflower cordial.The long summer evening smells of hot bracken, cut grass and meadowsweet. I lead the way up through the woods, over the sheep fields, and down through the gardens, pointing out the ruined Roman bath house and the sandstone walls of Muncaster Castle as proudly as if I’d built them myself. We see a hare lolloping over the lawns, a heron flying slowly across the valley, and house martins flitting to their mud nests in the corner of almost every window of the castle and its outbuildings, including our granary.We have coffee next morning at the Turntable cafe by the little steam railway and watch the first train puffing off towards Eskdale before we head to the Northern railway train next door and ask the guard if we can get off at Silecroft station (£3.50). “It’s a lovely journey this. You never get bored of it,” he says cheerfully.The ambitious England Coast Path, due at 2,795 miles to be the world’s longest coastal walking route, is opening in stages. Current plans, delayed by Covid, could see it finished by 2025. Last year, a 40-mile stretch south from Whitehaven opened, followed in February 2022 by 11 miles from Silecroft to Green Road. This is the section we’re following, as far as Millom, and we start with a short detour to see two standing stones called the Giant’s Grave. They are tall, carved with cup marks, and backed by the frowning bulk of Black Combe. We catch up with the well-signed coast path and emerge on the pebbly beach just as the lower tide sand emerges, perfect timing for a swim.The path winds through the flowers that cloak the side of Haverigg dunes: wild thyme, bedstraw, sheep’s-bit, bright pink centaury and delicate purple dune pansies. We stop for homemade cake at the Haverigg beach cafe before setting off along the sea wall, which circles a flooded iron ore mine. There are plans to enhance this area as a visitor attraction called Iron Line, drawing on its natural and cultural heritage.Great crested grebes are swimming on the water and terns with beaks full of small silver fish fly over the path just in front of us, heading for their nests nearby. Looping through this RSPB reserve, past two old lighthouses and a ruined windmill, views open up across the wide sands of the Duddon Estuary towards the fells beyond. Inland, we can see the spire of St George’s Church in Millom.The Cumbrian poet Norman Nicholson (1914-1987) lived in Millom and, with prescient environmental concern, celebrated this coast in his landscape poetry. Last year, an app was launched with heritage trails that trace the writer’s footsteps. He describes the lagoon we’ve just passed in Hodbarrow Flooded:Where once the shafts struck down through yielding limestone Black coot and moorhenLay snail-wakes on the waterFrom Millom station, we catch the train to Manchester via Barrow. Cancelled services mean we don’t arrive until midnight, but it’s worth it. One of the few good things about this delayed journey is watching the sun sink into Morecambe Bay, where the ribbed sands shine pink and the distant fells glow purple. Train travel was provided by Northern and Avanti West Coast. Lancaster from Manchester £20.50 return; advance tickets from London start around £30 each way). Accommodation was provided by Muncaster Castle (doubles at the Coachman’s Quarters from £80, room only).

The combination of these ingredients, with their acid, crunch, salt and smoke, make for a heady combination. If you find yourself near the sea over the summer, try giving line-caught fish the torta treatment for something that’s way more than the sum of its parts.I love using a sourdough bun for maximum goodness, but a ciabatta roll also works a treat.Prep 30 minCook 10 minServes 4400g haddock fillets60g plain flour1 egg, beaten80g panko breadcrumbsSalt and pepper4 tbsp sunflower oil4 sourdough buns1 bunch watercress, washed2-3 large gherkins, slicedFor the aïoli2 green chillies1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 small bunch coriander, rinsed and roughly chopped (stalks and all)1 lemon200g mayonnaiseCut the haddock into fat strips that can easily be divided between the buns.

Not at all. In fact, eating with your mouth open might just be the best way to experience food.I don’t believe you, but explain yourself. Research from the University of Oxford has revealed that chewing your food with your mouth open can help to release volatile organic compounds.Yes, help to release them all over the tablecloth, you disgusting oik. Not at all. The research revealed that opening your mouth can help aromatic compounds to reach the back of your nose. This, in turn, boosts your olfactory sensory neurons, which makes food taste better.I don’t follow. It’s a bit like swishing wine around in a glass before you drink it.Oh, now I understand. So will you do it?Absolutely not. Whatever happened to manners? Oh, you mean the societal construct invented to unnaturally regulate human behaviour, so as not to offend the sensibilities of an increasingly redundant ruling class?Yes, exactly. At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself a simple question: do you want to adhere to a pointless system of etiquette for the rest of your life, or do you want to enjoy food as it was designed to taste?The first one! Haven’t you been reading? Always the first one! OK, fine. If you want to improve the taste of your food, but you don’t want to open your mouth, there are alternative methods.Like what? Have you tried mindful eating? It’s a method that forces you to concentrate fully on whatever you happen to put in your mouth. With every forkful you ask yourself a series of questions. How does this taste? What temperature is it? Is it hard or soft, crunchy or chewy? How does it feel when I bite down on it? What emotions does it conjure?No, too laborious. Then you could try thoroughly chewing everything you eat. Smashing everything you eat into a fine mush before you swallow will not only aid your digestion and reduce stress on your oesophagus, but some claim that it can also make you more sensitive to taste.Also, too laborious. I don’t know, then. Just cover everything in loads of ketchup?If that’s what it takes … Or, you know, you could just be free and easy and try eating with your mouth open.Never! I really hope someone publishes a study that links putting your elbows on the table with immortality. You’d explode.Do say: “Eating with your mouth open can make things tastier.”Don’t say: “Unless you’re sitting opposite someone who is doing it.”There are more centenarians than ever in many countries around the world – including the UK.

       "  'A dizzying dining deck crowns the summit of the newly renovated Balfron Tower in Poplar, east London, perched like a crow’s nest on top of the brutalist concrete lift shaft. Floating almost 30 storeys up in the air, with spectacular views across the city, it marks the apex of a new dedicated tower of leisure facilities. Inside what was once the building’s service core and boiler house, connected to the flats by glazed bridges, there is now a cinema, library, gym, yoga space and music room, as well as a whole floor dedicated to table tennis.It sounds like the kind of lively, communal vision for high-rise living that Hungarian-born architect Ernő Goldfinger imagined when he first designed the building in 1963, as part of the wider Brownfield estate of council homes on this slum clearance site. “The success of any scheme depends on the human factor,” he said, “the relationship of people to each other and the frame of their daily life which the building provides.”As a committed Marxist, he intended his great concrete castle to provide exactly that kind of social frame for everyone, from all walks of life. He included rooms for table tennis and billiards, a “jazz/pop room” as well as a hobby room designed with older residents in mind. As far as possible, families were rehoused in the tower street by street, in an attempt to retain the neighbourly bonds along the new “streets in the sky”, designed like “East End pavements,” Goldfinger said, “on which the normal life of the neighbourhood continues”.Almost 60 years later, Balfron’s streets have been scrubbed up and the residents’ facilities turbo-charged, but the kind of community that Goldfinger imagined has long since been evicted. In one of the most high-profile examples of a cash-strapped housing association flogging off a desirable tower block to pay for new homes nearby – and using resident artists to raise the property values in the process – the 146 flats have been gutted and gussied up to be sold to wealthy buyers. Where once Balfron looked out over declining docks, it now winks across the Thames at the towers of Canary Wharf, whose bankers are a target audience for the new flats, which went on sale this weekend.“We’ve had a phenomenal amount of interest,” says Elliot Tucker of the developer Londonewcastle as he shows me around the building, alongside a couple of Notting Hill estate agents who specialise in selling villas in Ibiza. “It’s mostly coming from young first-time buyers in east London, as well as some affluent architects looking for a trophy property.”He says that one such architect has his heart set on flat 130 on the top floor. The reason? It is the very apartment where Goldfinger himself once lived with his wife, Ursula, when they moved into the building for two months in 1968 as a social experiment, hosting champagne parties to gather feedback from residents. The response was mostly positive, and Goldfinger used some of the lessons, including adding an extra lift, to inform the design of his taller Trellick Tower, built in west London in 1972. “Bar the complaints of draughts from some windows, heating that didn’t work, they all said the flats were lovely,” Ursula wrote in her diary during their Balfron stay. “Those I have been into are beautifully kept, people are going to a lot of trouble to install them mostly with outrageously terrible furniture, carpets, curtains and ornaments.”As part of the refurbishment, flat 130 has been designated as one of six “heritage” apartments, preserving the original layout and colour scheme, with some period fixtures added to match the originals. A high-cistern pull-chain toilet stands next door to an enamel steel bath (in separate rooms, as they were), while the kitchen features stainless steel worktops and vintage taps sourced from eBay, so brutalism fans can cosplay at being the Goldfingers. Tucker says the flat in question is being held back for now, and will probably be sold to the highest offer through sealed bids – an ironic fate for the champagne socialists’ penthouse.More than 1,200 interested buyers have already signed up, but Balfron hasn’t always been so desirable. When it opened in 1968, commissioned by the London County Council as one of the tallest towers in Europe, there was an immediate vocal backlash. “Although perversely beautiful,” wrote Terence Bendixson in the Guardian in 1969, the tower “conjures up thoughts of prisons and pillboxes. Here, too, vandalism is setting in.” Goldfinger was typecast as a megalomaniac, imposing dangerously foreign ideas on Britain – a reputation that was amplified by the James Bond author Ian Fleming naming his monstrous Soviet villain after him . It didn’t much help that even the building’s fans hailed its aggressive, alienating form. “It is as though Goldfinger, from among the Functionalist totems, had chosen as a source of inspiration the artefacts of war,” wrote his former colleague James Dunnett in 1983. “The sheer concrete walls of the circulation tower are pierced only by slits; cascading down the facade like rain, they impart a delicate sense of terror.”While the flats were enjoyed by most of their residents, the maintenance and upkeep of the tower plummeted after the dissolution of the Greater London Council (the LCC’s successor) in the 1980s, when it was taken over by Tower Hamlets council. Its new caretaker described it as “a disaster area … burnt-out cars, black soot stains, bin rooms full of old rubbish,” and it became a focus for vandalism and drug use in the 1990s. “The Balfron Tower gives Poplar a final mugging,” wrote Simon Jenkins in the Times in 2000. “Its footings are a no-go area for humanity. Trash, chicken-wire and graffiti abound. The tower is without charm or visual diversion. It makes Wormwood Scrubs seem like the Petit Trianon. Poverty is not Poplar’s curse. The curse is architecture.”Two years on, the building provided an apocalyptic film set for the zombie horror movie 28 Days Later, and by 2014, it was branded “Britain’s ugliest building” by the Mirror. Yet, the very same year, the National Trust opened a pop-up flat in the tower, with retro interiors styled by Wayne Hemingway, charging visitors £12 a time to sample the vintage timewarp. It was a sign that, outside the tabloid hatred of postwar modernism, the popular tide was turning to embrace Balfron’s brutalist aesthetics. With its striking form emblazoned on tote bags, cushions and coffee cups, just like Trellick (which remains predominantly council housing) and the Barbican (which never was), the building took on a marketable image that transcended its original social purpose. Egalitarian quotes from Goldfinger are proudly printed on the construction hoardings, and the marketing suite is something of a Goldfinger shrine, despite the luxury flats bearing no relation to his aims.Given that the development’s chief selling point is Balfron’s status as a beloved icon of brutalism, and that many of the potential buyers are likely hardcore fans, it is strange that, apart from the six “heritage” units, all of the flats have been completely stripped of their original details. In the hands of lead architects Studio Egret West, working with Ab Rogers Design, the partition walls have been removed to create open-plan living spaces, of a kind familiar to most new-build apartment blocks, while the fixtures and fittings reflect generic contemporary taste, with some faintly retro touches.The flats designed by Rogers are a little more quirky, with red bathroom ceilings and oversized tiles, while the other half, by Egret West, opt for cork bedroom floors and terrazzo splash-backs. But both could be anywhere. The sole reminder that you are in a brutalist landmark is a ghoulish plant stand, to be given to new buyers, made from little concrete cylinders that were drilled out of the building during structural testing. It’s like mutilating an old friend and putting their dismembered limbs on show.Outside the flats, in the common areas of the building, the architects have dutifully restored the original finishes as far as possible, sourcing similar coloured tiles for the walls of the different streets, and rich green marble for the entrance lobby. An exception is the new door numbers: typographers may have a heart attack when they see the jaunty curves of what looks suspiciously like Comic Sans (but which turns out to be a custom designed font by Ryan Gander, based on Ursula Goldfinger’s handwriting in her diary). It’s a minor detail compared with the most egregious alteration of this Grade II*-listed building, found on the facade itself. Where once rose Goldfinger’s striking grid of white-painted wooden window frames, now stretch sleek bands of dark glass framed by brown-anodised aluminium, as if transplanted here from a 1980s business park.“It’s a tragic missed opportunity,” says Catherine Croft, director of the Twentieth Century Society, which successfully campaigned to have the tower’s status upgraded from Grade II to II* in 2014. “Surely brutalism now has enough fans that a conserved Balfron could be successfully marketed as a unique opportunity to live in a genuinely iconic brutalist masterpiece. Now all that’s left is an ersatz hybrid.”The 2012 renovation of Carradale House, another Goldfinger block next door, saw its windows replaced with modern double-glazed timber frames to the original design, showing it could have been eminently possible at Balfron, too. But the architects defend their decision as in keeping with the spirit of the building. “Throughout the project, we have aimed to imagine what Goldfinger would do today,” says Christophe Egret, “and felt replacing the windows was in tune with his original vision.”From the outside, the building may look like it has had its eyes gouged out and replaced with naff mirrored shades, but the real impact of the change is felt on the inside. While the original windows were fully openable, allowing gusts of air to flow through the double-aspect flats from one side to the other, most of the new bedroom windows are sealed shut. On my morning visit, one east-facing bedroom had reached 30C, while it was in the low-20s outside.The architects say the proximity of the busy A13 road meant that non-openable windows were required to protect the residents from noise and pollution, and that a “sophisticated natural ventilation system” will keep the rooms cool (the developer says it was not switched on during my visit). But if you’re shelling out £375,000 for a one-bed flat, or £800,000 for a four-bed – along with an average annual service charge of £3,300 – the least you might expect is to be able to open your bedroom window.For Michael Newman, the transformation of Balfron Tower is a bitter blow. He lived in a council flat on the 21st floor from the late 1980s, until he was “decanted” a few years ago to make way for the new buyers. “I really loved living there,” he tells me. “It was a complete cross-section of society. My neighbours included a retired soldier who had been in Burma, a carpenter in his 80s who cycled everywhere, a young Somali family and a born-again Christian. The views were amazing – I was woken by the sun rising every morning, then saw the sun setting over the city from my living room and kitchen. It was beautiful.”He describes the moment when the estate was transferred from the ownership of Tower Hamlets council to the Poplar Harca housing association in 2007, after a residents’ ballot. “We were told that if we voted for it, they would refurbish our flats,” he says. “They even built a show flat, kitted out with the brand-new kitchens and bathrooms we would all get.”After years of inaction, residents received a notice in 2010 that they would have to leave the building while refurbishment works took place – but there was no mention of whether they would be able to return to their homes after the renovations. “I kept asking Harca, but they just said they didn’t know,” says Newman. “The psychological stress was unimaginable.” Residents were informed that it was “possible but not probable” that they would have a right of return, with Poplar Harca citing “the impact of the global financial downturn” and planning setbacks as reasons for the uncertainty. In an FAQ factsheet distributed to residents by the housing association, “Can I move back in when the works are complete?” was listed as “one of the questions we just don’t know the answer to yet”.David Roberts, a researcher at University College London who co-led the Grade II*-listing campaign, has documented the building and its regeneration process in forensic detail. As part of his award-winning PhD research, he compiled dozens of documents from five decades on a dedicated website, including a confidential viability report produced by the Homes and Communities Agency in 2012. The report confidently stated in no uncertain terms: “Balfron will become a leaseholder-only block.”Rubbing gentrifying salt into the gaping wound, as the building was being emptied of its tenants, Harca invited artists to occupy some of the flats in a temporary “guardianship” scheme, in collaboration with Bow Arts Trust. “I went to a cheese and wine party of one of the painters,” Newman recalls. “He had made beautiful paintings of the building, but there were no local residents in the room. Most of the artists didn’t realise that the council tenants weren’t going to be allowed back, and they were being used to celebrate the death of the community. When I look at the building now, it feels like a gravestone.” He adds that he doesn’t blame Poplar Harca, and that he is happy in his new home in Carradale House, but he sees the project as a symptom of “a political system that prioritises economics over community”.Others see the refurbishment as a pragmatic solution, given the lack of government funding for social housing. “Some residents were very happy there,” says one former Balfron leaseholder, who was part of the residents’ association. “But there were also a great many families living in overcrowded conditions who couldn’t wait to leave. I think it made sense to capitalise on the niche love of the heroic brutalist building, and sell the flats to people who actually wanted to live there, in order to provide much more suitable homes for families nearby.”It chimes with Poplar Harca’s justification: “By concentrating sales in the higher-valued Balfron Tower, it was found that fewer social rented properties would need to be sold overall,” says a spokesperson, “and a sensitive refurbishment of the Grade II*-listed building could be achieved.” So how much has the great sell-off achieved? Across the Brownfield estate, Harca says the regeneration has seen a net increase of 45 habitable rooms, due to the higher number of larger family properties – but an overall loss of 21 social rented homes.From their new private rooftop garden, in between games of ping pong and cinema screenings, the new Balfron residents will be able to look down on what they helped to pay for, elevated on the summit of what was taken away from the community in the process. Although, actually, they won’t see much: for health and safety reasons, the roof garden has been surrounded by a new 2-metre high concrete balustrade that almost entirely blocks the view.Damien Hirst, the artist famous for pickling dead animals in the 1990s, is to burn thousands of his paintings next month in a project focusing on art as currency.Hirst, who was the UK’s richest artist in 2020 with a net worth of more than £315m, will destroy the artworks at his London gallery. He created 10,000 unique dot paintings in 2016, each with its own title, that were later linked to corresponding NFTs and sold for $2,000 each. Buyers were given the option of keeping the NFTs or trading them in for the physical artwork. “The collector … cannot keep both. This exchange is a one-way process, so choose carefully,” buyers were told.Twenty-four hours before a deadline of 3pm Wednesday, 4,180 people had chosen to swap their NFT for a physical artwork, with 5,820 opting to keep their NFTs, according to Heni, a technology company focusing on the art market.The alternative version is to be destroyed, with the physical artworks – oil on paper – going up in flames on a daily basis from 9 September.Hirst’s project, titled The Currency, was an “interesting experiment”, the artist told Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, in a YouTube video interview last year. “It’s an installation, really, but like a global one … The involvement of everybody is part of The Currency project. It’s as much about the movement of the objects as it is about the objects.”NFTs have exploded on the global art market in the past couple of years, with major auction houses securing astronomical sums for top-end works. In March 2021, Christie’s sold Everydays: the First 5,000 Days by the digital artist known as Beeple for a record $69m.Hirst, 57, was one of the Young British Artists (YBAs) – along with Tracey Emin, Gavin Turk and Sam Taylor-Johnson (formerly Sam Taylor-Wood) – who dominated the UK art world in the 1990s, supported by the advertising mogul Charles Saatchi.He produced a series of artworks in which dead animals, some of them dissected – including a shark, a sheep and a cow – were preserved in formaldehyde.According to the 2020 Sunday Times rich list, Hirst had a property portfolio worth about £150m, including a Palladian mansion overlooking Regent’s Park, and a 2,000-piece art collection that included works by Picasso and Francis Bacon.Ask people about Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose 150th anniversary we celebrate this year, and you might be told either that he is hands down Britain’s favourite composer or a parochial embarrassment whose music sounds like “a cow looking over a gate” (to quote one critic). Both judgements are usually based on just two pieces: Fantasia on a theme by Thomas Tallis and The Lark Ascending, which have appeared at or near the top of the Classic FM Hall of Fame poll for 20 years. In 1958, in the last year of his life, he was unquestionably the grand old man of English music, yet his last major work, the ninth symphony – to my mind a masterpiece – was written off by many critics as old hat.Vaughan Williams, whose 150th anniversary we celebrate this year, has always been in and out of fashion. Many listeners have an “a-ha” moment, whether it be one of enlightenment or rejection. Mine, the former, took place listening to his fifth symphony. Written during the dark days of 1942, it left its audience speechless, tearful and grateful for its message of peace and hope. But I knew none of this when, a blank-slate teenager, I put needle to LP and within seconds – a low drone in the strings, two visionary horns, some dreamy violins – I was hooked. That will not make much sense unless you have heard it. So, take a moment out of your busy day. If the symphony’s first minute is not your thing, listen to the very last, a wordless alleluia the like of which is heard at the gates of heaven. If you are still not charmed, keep reading. There are many sides to Vaughan Williams, as I quickly found.The course of my love did not run smooth. I grew impatient with the Pastoral Symphony (no 3), staring into the vacant eyes of that cow, and then I ran away scared from the fourth Symphony which assaulted my tender ears. I hear both differently now. The Pastoral is a requiem for the young men lost in the first world war, some of them friends and students of the composer. It was conceived on long, quiet evenings in northern France as the sun set over the battlefields where Vaughan Williams served as an ambulance driver. He witnessed things, as so many did, that he was never to speak of, except perhaps in music. The fourth symphony I now hear as a post-war expression of rage, dissonant from first to last, a hellish gate that might appeal to my previously unimpressed reader.Vaughan Williams was slow to find his own musical voice. In his student days, England still looked to Germany for its musical models – Mendelssohn and Brahms – so he was the despair of his harmony professor when sample minuets came out modal. (Think Fred Astaire in clogs.) From his late 30s, however, he evolved into a one-man musical institution. He edited Anglican hymnbook The English Hymnal, cycled around country pubs collecting folk songs, was active in the English Folk Dance Society, though himself something of a galumpher, and conducted amateur choirs and professional orchestras with passion and the occasional burst of temper. As the second world war neared its end, he was the one authorities turned to for “A Song of Thanksgiving”, to be ready for VE Day. And he was a beloved teacher who supported young composers financially and in other practical ways. He once had to bring to heel an orchestra which was openly laughing at a young, then unknown Benjamin Britten. Perhaps most importantly, he set up what is now the RVW Charitable Trust which still distributes his royalties to fund new works. Never having had children of his own, these beneficiaries are in effect his musical heirs.English through and through, Vaughan Williams was steeped in his country’s literature and art, old and new. He set words of Housman and Kipling, Shakespeare (try the Serenade to Music from The Merchant of Venice) and Herbert (Five Mystical Songs’s Love bade me welcome – you will thank me!), and there is an opera on Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress. The closing scene of HG Wells’s Tono-Bungay inspired the atmospheric end of A London Symphony (“Light after light goes down … London passes – England passes”) and that “old hat” ninth symphony was sparked by Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles. You can even hear the eight o’clock chimes marking the moment of Tess’s execution.The scenario and music of Job, a Masque for dancing (not a ballet – he disliked “over-developed calves”) were based closely on William Blake’s illustrations to the Book of Job, and the hall-of-famous Tallis Fantasia is gothic architecture in music. Vaughan Williams confessed that he himself sometimes did not know whether he had composed a piece or merely remembered it. He likened the process to seeing Stonehenge, New York or Niagara Falls for the first time: it was as if he already knew them. The Tallis Fantasia sounds as if the musicians are reading not sheet music but runes carved on rock.For some, however, Vaughan Williams’s very Englishness can be a barrier to appreciation. I have been lucky enough to perform his music outside the UK and see how it touches and speaks to musicians and audiences who know nothing of its cultural roots. The most common reaction to hearing one of the symphonies is a sort of bemused appetite for more: how many of these are there? Why didn’t we know them already? And I owe Vaughan Williams a debt of thanks. Ten years ago the North German Radio Philharmonic asked me to become its chief conductor as a direct result of a performance of the sixth symphony – a devastating piece completed soon after the second world war. Listen to its post-apocalypse ending, 10 minutes of all but silent, static music (and spare a thought for the orchestras that play this shatteringly difficult piece).Cultural roots lie deep and old. Dig deep enough, as Vaughan Williams did, and you find the roots of music entangled, shared even with other cultures, on a bedrock of pentatonics, ancient modes, hymns, chorales and folk dance. Perhaps for that reason Vaughan Williams had so much respect for Sibelius, the great Finnish composer to whom he dedicated that marvellous fifth symphony “without permission”. Their music sounds and feels totally different but they were both mining the same deep cultural seam. And it is for that reason that I believe Vaughan Williams’s music has lasted in our estimation and will for a long time, though fashions come and go. Calling the ninth symphony “old hat” was intended as an insult. I hear the piece however as the summation of a life’s work, tired-sounding perhaps but deservedly so after such long, rich creativity.  Andrew Manze conducts the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in Vaughan William’s First Symphony on 27 July at the Royal Albert Hall, London. Vaughan Williams’ music is celebrated throughout this year’s Proms season.Comment: The Booker longlist is thoughtfully curated and gives Alan Garner overdue recognitionThis year’s Booker prize longlist, described as “challenging, stimulating, surprising, nourishing” by the chair of judges, contains the youngest and oldest authors ever to be nominated for the award.Leila Mottley, who is just 20, and Alan Garner, who is 87, are among 13 writers to make the longlist for this year’s prize, which chair of judges Neil MacGregor said offers “story, fable and parable, fantasy, mystery, meditation and thriller”.Cultural historian and writer MacGregor is joined on the judging panel by academic and broadcaster Shahidha Bari; historian Helen Castor; author and critic M John Harrison; and novelist and poet Alain Mabanckou. The judges read a total of 169 submissions.MacGregor said the longlisted books are “exceptionally well written and carefully crafted” and “seem to us to exploit and expand what the language can do”.The list is light on big names – previous years have seen authors including Hilary Mantel and Kazuo Ishiguro nominated – with Garner among the most famous authors to make the cut. He is best known for his award-winning 1967 novel The Owl Service.Garner is longlisted for Treacle Walker, about a young boy called Joe who is visited by a wanderer and healer, sparking an unlikely friendship. If he goes on to win, Garner would be the oldest winner ever, turning 88 on the day of this year’s award ceremony.At the other end of the scale is Mottley, the youngest writer ever to be longlisted. The record was previously held by Jon McGregor; he was 26 when his debut If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things made the list in 2002. Mottley wrote Nightcrawling when she 17, inspired by a real-life case of police officers sexually abusing a young woman in Oakland, California. Mottley is one of six American authors to make this year’s list, alongside Hernan Diaz, Percival Everett, Karen Joy Fowler, Selby Wynn Schwartz and Elizabeth Strout. Also on the list is NoViolet Bulawayo, who was born in Zimbabwe but now lives in the US. Their dominance may well reignite the debate around the decision to open the Booker prize to US authors in 2014.There are three Britons on the list – Garner, Maddie Mortimer and Scottish writer Graeme Macrae Burnet – as well as two authors from Ireland: Claire Keegan and Audrey Magee. The final spot is taken by Shehan Karunatilaka, who is the second Sri Lankan in two years to be nominated.Mottley’s Nightcrawling is one of three debuts on the list, alongside Mortimer’s Maps of Our Spectacular Bodies and Schwartz’s After Sappho. Mortimer’s novel, which tells the story of a woman with cancer trying to come to terms with her illness, and is partially narrated by the cancer cells in her body, recently won the Desmond Elliot prize. After Sappho begins in 1880s Italy, introducing the baby who will grow up to become the Italian poet Lina Poletti, and moves forward through time spotlighting groundbreaking writers and artists including Virginia Woolf, Josephine Baker and Radclyffe Hall.Four authors – Bulawayo, Fowler, Burnet and Strout – have been nominated for the award before.Bulawayo is listed for Glory, which is narrated by a chorus of animals and inspired by George Orwell’s Animal Farm. A response to the fall of Robert Mugabe, it describes a coup that ousts Old Horse as leader after 40 years in power, alongside his despised wife, a donkey named Marvellous. Burnet, who was shortlisted for the prize in 2016 for His Bloody Project, is this year longlisted for Case Study, about a woman who believes a charismatic psychotherapist has driven her sister to suicide. Strout’s Oh William! is part of her Lucy Barton series, and sees the character reconnect with her first husband. It was with her first Lucy Barton book, My Name is Lucy Barton, that Strout was shortlisted for the Booker in 2016.Fowler’s Booth is a historical novel about the man who shot Abraham Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth, and his family. Fowler was previously shortlisted in 2014 for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. Also invoking a real-life figure is Everett’s The Trees, in which detectives investigate a series of murders in Money, Mississippi, where Emmett Till was lynched 65 years earlier.The shortest book on the list is Keegan’s 116-page Small Things Like These, set in the run-up to Christmas 1985 in a small Irish town. Fellow Irish author Magee makes the list for The Colony, in which two men spend the summer on a sparsely populated island, while Hernan Diaz is longlisted for Trust, centred on a 1920s Wall Street tycoon. The list is completed by Karunatilaka’s The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida, about a war photographer caught up in the horrors of civil war. MacGregor said the books on the list “reflect – and reflect on – the preoccupations of our planet over the last few years”, addressing how “we imagine disease as a living enemy to be fought on a daily basis, questions of racial and gender injustice, and the fragility of the political order”.Two larger themes that emerged, he said, are the “extent to which individual lives are shaped and determined by long historical processes” and “the elusive nature of truth: not in the sense that we live in a post-truth world, but in demonstrating the persistence, energy and scepticism required to get as near as is possible to truth, and so to a proper understanding, whether of one particular person, or of a nation-destroying civil war”.The 2022 longlist has a strong showing of independent publishers; of the 13 novels, eight are published by indies, with four from small presses, including Influx and Sort Of, making the longlist for the first time. Of the remaining five, two are published by Penguin Random House, two by Pan Macmillan and one by HarperCollins.Gaby Wood, director of the Booker prize foundation, said: “The 2022 Booker judges come from very different corners of the reading world, yet from the moment they met they have revelled in each other’s opinions and delighted in each other’s company.“The result is a set of books that are sometimes serious but never sombre, whose authors engage you with their wit, even as you absorb their dramatic, painful or provocative subject matter. It’s in this playfulness, of form or tone, that this year’s fiction is at its best.”The shortlist of six books will be announced on 6 September and the winner will be announced on 17 October.Glory by NoViolet BulawayoTrust by Hernan DiazThe Trees by Percival EverettBooth by Karen Joy FowlerTreacle Walker by Alan GarnerThe Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shahan KarunatilakaSmall Things Like These by Claire KeeganCase Study by Graeme Macrae BurnetThe Colony by Audrey MageeMaps of Our Spectacular Bodies by Maddie MortimerNightcrawling by Leila MottleyAfter Sappho by Selby Lynn SchwartzOh William! by Elizabeth StroutNovelists Ali Smith, Jackie Kay and Guy Gunaratne are to judge a new, expanded Rathbones Folio prize for 2023. The prize is set to expand to three categories, filling a gap left by the demise of the Costa book awards.Launched in 2014, the Folio prize has been awarded annually to a work of literature. In 2017, it was opened to nonfiction and poetry as well, although it still named only one winner a year.For 2023, the prize will expand to three categories: fiction, nonfiction and poetry, with a winner named in each who will go on to compete for the overall prize.The new format is an echo of the Costa book awards, which came to a sudden end earlier this year. The Costas crowned winners in five categories – novel, debut novel, nonfiction, poetry and children’s – with the category winners going on to compete for the overall book of the year.The expanded Rathbones Folio prize will have shortlists of four books in each of its three categories, and the winner of each category will receive £2,000. The overall winner will then get an additional £30,000.Organisers said they had “decided to refresh its format to address the changing landscape of literary prizes, including the recent discontinuation of awards such as the Costa book awards, and the impact this has for writers”.In a statement, the prize’s executive director Minna Fry and co-founder and chair Andrew Kidd said: “We and our brilliantly supportive sponsors Rathbones are hugely excited about this new refinement and expansion of the existing format. It will significantly aid what has always been this prize’s ultimate aim: to help publishers and booksellers to put more of the best books being published today – as chosen by writers themselves (a feature unique to this prize) – into the hands of more readers.”The judges are chosen each year from the members of the Folio Academy, and titles for consideration are nominated by its members. The shortlists for the 2023 awards will be revealed early next year, with the category and overall winners announced at a ceremony at the British Library in March.Previous Folio prize winners include Colm Tóibín, Carmen Maria Machado, Raymond Antrobus, Hisham Matar and George Saunders.Writer-director Evan Jackson Leong’s tale of a street-smart illegal immigrant who gets taken under the wing of a charismatic older gangster follows a well-worn plot beat-for-beat, right down to the inevitable montage in the midsection set to slinky pop. The kicker is that the apprentice and the master are women, exhibiting much the same unflinching ruthlessness you would find in a Martin Scorsese, Johnnie To or Park Chan-wook movie, but with a little less violence. But that doesn’t mean no violence: at one point, New York Chinatown kingpin Dai Mah (Jade Wu), a character based on a real female crime boss, slits a man’s throat with the effortless focus of a butcher slaughtering a pig, and barely gets a drop of blood on her dowdy polyester housecoat.The deliberately chintzy costume design adds a subtle spark of authenticity, underscoring that these are people who care very little about what they look like. Dai Mah and her lieutenant Sister Tse (a magnetic Shuya Chang) are laser-focused on the goal of making money by any means possible – in Dai Mah’s case because she is greedy and power mad. Sister Tse, on the other hand, needs to pay off a $57,000 debt to Dai Mah, the price to have herself trafficked to the US. As Tse’s voiceover explains, she didn’t come looking for anything so common as a better life: she is there to find her daughter who was taken from her eight years ago and adopted by an American couple while Tse languished in jail. That maternal goal means she will put up with a lot, such as enforced sex work for a short spell (she catches Dai Mah’s eye by nearly killing a vicious pimp with a metal chain), the drudgery of debt collection and hours of dumpling making in the kitchen alongside kindly African immigrant Zareeb (Yacine Djoumbaye), who speaks French, Mandarin and English.While the underlying structure is undeniably generic, the film-makers have poured care into the details, from the use of convincingly grotty locations to the woozy, smeary camerawork by Ray Huang that recalls the dreamy atmosphere of early Wong Kar-wai. Even the soft, hazy cello-intensive score has a Wong vibe, but somehow the package as a whole feels like a smooth synthesis of elements instead of a derivative rip-off. Snakehead is released on 1 August on digital platforms.Reading our games correspondent Keith Stuart’s feature about the joy of game compilations, it struck me that playing five games over a weekend has become almost unthinkable. My friends who grew up in the 1980s consumed as many games on tape as they could, but by the 90s we had slowed down. Games were more sophisticated, they had more to offer, and it would take the whole weekend (or sometimes the week) to get the most out of whatever cartridge you had borrowed from Blockbuster or spent months’ worth of pocket money to buy.Things started to change in the 00s: games didn’t last 10 or 20 hours, but 50 or more. There have always been long games – think of Japanese role-playing games, which stole many hours of my teenage life through random battles and grinding, or PC strategy games that could swallow about as many hours as you gave them, or indeed Championship Manager and Football Manager – but landmark open-world games such as Grand Theft Auto and The Elder Scrolls started to make huge games the norm. And of course, World of Warcraft, EverQuest and Guild Wars also appeared, starting a boom in online games that has just … never ended.For a while these endless games were confined to PCs, and they were niche. Massively multiplayer online role-player games were a trend in the mid-00s, like mobile was in the 00s and VR was until recently: they sucked up all of the investor money in games and rarely produced interesting results. There were many high-profile flops in the endless-game genre: The Matrix Online, Tabula Rasa (made by Richard Garriott, the mind behind OG online game Ultima Online), The Sims Online, Age of Conan and even Star Wars Galaxies.The MMO genre might not have been the future of gaming, but elements of that genre are pervasive. I now earn loot and experience points in blimmin’ Forza Horizon, a game about driving shiny cars around in the sunshine. An Assassin’s Creed game will now be 200 hours long and bolstered by seasons of extra content to keep you playing even longer; Grand Theft Auto Online has turned an already lengthy game into one you can play forever. Shooters became infinite timesinks – Destiny, Fortnite and Call of Duty expect you to play for years, not just blast through a campaign and play deathmatch with friends for a while. MMOs never became the dominant genre, but they have influenced the mainstream.I don’t feel great about a trajectory that has led from playing many different things from different developers, cultures and genres to playing just one thing for years. It mirrors the entertainment monoculture that we’re seeing everywhere else, too, from the Marvel Cinematic Universe to endless Star Wars expansions and episodes of Stranger Things that are longer than most films. Pop culture seems to give people something they like, and then give them endless content related to that thing. Why risk making something new when you can make another iteration of Spider-Man? Why invest millions in a new developer’s fun idea when you could just get people to play Fifa forever? In gaming, as elsewhere, it creates an entertainment culture that is a wide, shallow pool – a successful thing must be extended and expanded until everyone is sick of it.I’d love to see a modern interpretation of the old compilation cassette-tapes that were a previous generation’s formative gaming diet. Playdate, the boutique games console that releases different seasons of entertaining esoteric games every week, captures that vibe for me. Or imagine a publisher that put together small collections of hour-long long games by different developers, all on a theme: grief, love, the climate crisis. I’d love to knock through several games in a weekend again, rather than looking glumly at an Xbox or PlayStation storefront full of live-service games that require as much commitment as a marriage. Teenagers view this as normal, and to them I am the definition of “old (wo)man yells at cloud” – but I really believe that everyone benefits from a broader gaming diet.I am an absolute sucker for an any game, novel or TV series that changes genre, theme or setting every few hours, or presents several interconnected stories. My teenage mind was blown by David Mitchell’s Ghostwritten and I’ve sought out this flavour of fiction ever since. So the long-delayed global release of Live a Live, a Japanese RPG that takes you through seven characters’ totally different stories set throughout human history, has made me very happy. First released in 1994, and made by Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy IV mastermind Takashi Tokita, it is an artefact of a more adventurous and creative time in Japanese game development – unpredictable and weird and a bit rude.Available on: Nintendo SwitchApproximate playtime: 20-25 hoursThe next Fifa game – which, remember, will officially be EA’s last in the series – will feature women’s club football for the first time, having included (some) women’s international teams since 2015. Along with 2K’s inclusion of WNBA teams in its basketball games, this represents a big step up for the representation of women’s sport in the virtual realm. 11-year-old me would have been delighted.The superlative Papers, Please, a game about being a border control agent in a fictional eastern bloc country that reveals an uncomfortable amount about whomever plays it, is coming to mobile next month. It is still extremely relevant. I’ll take any opportunity to revisit this Tweet by developer and NYU games lecturer Robert Yang, too:whenever I taught Papers Please in college classes, discussion was always like --US students: \"this is obviously about russia\"international students: \"this is obviously about america\" https://t.co/NCAlThe6tzThe cat game Stray has taken off. This is pleasing, because it is an inventive and creative game that deserves success, and because people keep posting videos of their cats reacting to the game, and those videos give me life.With apologies to anyone who thinks I feature too much Lego in this section: the Atari 2600 Lego set is out on 1 August, complete with a pop-up portrait of an 80s living room and dioramas of Atari’s classic games.I made a radio documentary about video games called Generation Games: From Pong to Pokémon. It’s about how games have changed our lives over the past 50 years, and it will be on BBC Radio 4 at 8pm BST this Saturday (30 July).How to save money when you buy video games and consolesWhen life gives you lemons, video games can be the escape we need, writes Dominik DiamondMinecraft developers won’t allow NFTs on the gaming platform101 ways the arts can slightly improve your lifeThis week’s question comes from reader Adam: I have recently been playing Assemble With Care and enjoy giving life back to broken things. Can you recommend other games that are about mending, renovating or repairing?What a beautiful question. I also love Assemble With Care – a game about taking apart objects and exploring their emotional history, too. There should be more games about restoring rather than destroying, shouldn’t there? I immediately thought of PowerWash Simulator, a game in which you methodically remove grime from filthy things, because it appears to have unexpectedly beguiled a number of my friends. In GNOG, you mess around satisfyingly with stylish machines and robots until they function as intended. There’s Jalopy, a game about trying to get from East Berlin to Turkey in a terrible old car that keeps breaking down, necessitating that you repair it. But none of these quite fit the bill, do they? There are plenty of games about arranging things, but not specifically about repairing them. I’m going to throw this one out to the readers: can you recommend games about repairing things?\\n\\n        \\n            Tue 26 Jul 2022 07.00\\xa0BST\\n\\n\\n            Last modified on Tue 26 Jul 2022 11.30\\xa0BST\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  'Name: Richard Branson.Age: 72.Richard Branson? Rings a bell. Just remind … So Sir Richard Branson was like the old Elon Musk, before the real Elon Musk came along. Largely superseded these days.Got it. Virgin, right? And still going? Going strong, partying hard.Ooh, I love a billionaire party. Do tell. It was supposed to be his 70th but that got delayed, because Covid.And just a low-key affair I imagine – little Italian restaurant,  close friends and family. Don’t be daft – it was a surprise five-night Caribbean cruise on one of his luxury Virgin Voyages luxury ships. On his blog there’s a helpful link to Virgin Voyages’ site, with some tasty-looking discounts, in case you’re inspired to book a voyage yourself.Now that is classy: birthday party-slash-marketing opportunity. Any dress code at all? Richard Branson.Yeah, you said. I know whose party; I’m asking about the dress code. I know, and I’m saying Richard Branson.Eh? So one night there was a Richard Through the Decades soiree. “It was a little bizarre but also hilarious seeing the creativity and fun people had put into their costumes,” blogged Branson. “From people inside mini-hot air balloons to ripped clothes from many near-death escapades, to recreating my Student magazine days in the 60s.”Now that is hilarious. Also inspirational, and energising. A whole ship full of Richard Bransons. Another night the dress code was all-white.Why am I getting David Brent vibes here? And Richard’s musician son Sam performed a song called Sympathy for the Legend, inspired by the Rolling Stones hit.Now you’ve taken me straight to Succession – you know,  Logan’s birthday party episode. Meets Carry On Cruising maybe. There were shore excursions too, to the incredible Virgin Voyages beach club in Bimini, in the Bahamas, to meet some entrepreneurs and Bimini business owners …Inspirational ones? Inspirational entrepreneurs, obvs.At a birthday party, though! There was also a diving trip in the caves in Rio Secreto in Mexico. Richard had a brilliant time, “making the most of being onboard our fantastic new ship, and taking part in activities close to my heart – supporting entrepreneurs and conserving the environment”.Yeah, because cruise ships are well known for being really great for the environment. Well …Do say: “For he’s a jolly good fe-e-llow … and so say all of us!”Don’t say: “The bars? I’ve come as 1971 Richard, in jail, arrested for tax evasion.”“We take healthcare to people who need it most,” says Sive O’Regan, a health inclusion nurse with the NHS service Find and Treat, whose team in London cares for the city’s homeless, sex workers, drug addicts and asylum seekers. “We work with disadvantaged and marginalised groups who don’t get much healthcare normally.” Nurse Yasmine Appleby of the UCLH Find and Treat service at work on the Strand in London. She looksfor the cause of Clifford Hughes’ tooth pain before encouraging him to have a chest X-ray to check for tuberculosis, and a Covid booster jab. Clifford is homeless and living on the street.Unlike typical NHS services, Find and Treat, which is run by the University College London hospitals trust (UCLH), is proactive rather than reactive. Its team of doctors, nurses and outreach workers are trained to identify people among vulnerable populations who need treatment and to administer care in a sensitive way.To do this, two vans fitted with medical equipment serve as mobile health clinics, which stop near hostels, drug services and soup kitchens. People frequenting these services are at a higher risk of contracting blood-borne viruses, sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis or Covid-19. Here, patients can be assessed and diagnosed on the spot.Find and Treat’s main van includes a mobile X-ray machine, which the staff use to test for tuberculosisO’Regan works on the smaller van, which she calls “the blood van” because it tests for blood-borne infections such as hepatitis B and C, HIV and STIs, including syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea. The bigger van, a long white vehicle bearing the service’s name and UCLH logo, is fitted with a mobile X-ray machine that is used to test for tuberculosis. “Every week, we spend the week in a different part of London and link up with places like hostels and drug services, to arrange to come and do some testing on their sites in the back of our van,” she says.In the smaller of the blood van’s two rooms, people are asked to detail their drug use, alcohol intake and sexual behaviour, to help the doctors establish how likely they are to have been exposed to diseases. “These are serious diseases. These viruses are spread very easily, so if you share equipment it’s very likely that you will get it,” says O’Regan.Above: Inclusion Health CNS Sive O’Regan gives Theo, a former dancer from Paris now homeless in south London, a Covid-19 vaccine and has a chat about his physical and mental health. Right, O’Regan gives another homeless man, Sam French, a Covid-19 vaccine, while outreach specialist Adrian Bean Noctor logs details of treatment administered throughout the day. Far right, O’Regan gives Eyob Yohannes a Covid-19 vaccineThose who have shared drug equipment are offered new needles, to prevent the spread of hepatitis C, which is closely associated with intravenous drug-taking. This is “an important public health intervention”, says O’Regan. Find and Treat tests asylum seekers and refugees for hepatitis B, which is more prevalent in the countries they come from than Britain. Both diseases are very treatable with medication, O’Regan stresses. The team operating in the evenings offer their services to street-based sex workers.O’Regan and her colleagues take a tiny amount of blood from a patient’s fingertip and, using testing equipment onboard, can find out within 15 minutes if the patient has any infection. During this time they offer a fibroscan to test the health of the liver for anyone who has a history of heavy drinking. Unidentified liver disease can lead to death from liver failure or cancer. But anyone found with cirrhosis can start treatment right away. This is how, the Irish nurse points out, Find and Treat’s intervention saves lives.Working with vulnerable patientshas its challenges. “Not having a home is not generally good for your health because that can deny you access to care. These groups don’t always get the care and compassion that healthcare professionals usually extend to the general population,” says O’Regan. “If you experience hostility time and time again, that’s going to create a resistance to healthcare, for example a resistance to taking medications that are good for them, and mistrust of the system. Our job is not just to find the infections but also to rebuild trust.“The work we do is really important because these are hard to reach populations that tend to be ostracised from society in general. We have a lot of fun. It’s really rewarding to see someone go through treatment who was reluctant [to engage] in the first place, and come out the other end.” Building a rapport with patients is vital.Ousainou Sarr, above, now works as a tuberculosis outreach worker for the service that saved his lifeThat is where the team’s peer support workers like Ousainou Sarr come in. The former restaurant manager lost his job years ago, ended up homeless and contracted tuberculosis, an airborne condition spread by coughing and sneezing. After battling symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss and night sweats for years, he spotted a leaflet for Find and Trace in 2011. He received an X-ray in the back of the big van and began treatment – then joined as one of its staff.Sarr, who was born in the Gambia, is now an integral member of the team on the tuberculosis van. “My main role is to talk to people, give them a leaflet about [tuberculosis] and persuade them to come and get screened. When they ask why they should get screened, I say that getting X-rayed is important and that rough sleepers are more likely to get [tuberculosis].” Homeless people’s habit of “skippering” – gathering in groups for food, warmth and company – increases their risk of tuberculosis. His experience of homelessness and the disease helps him convince people to do what he did and get X-rayed.“[Tuberculosis] screening makes a big difference in people’s lives. To get these people into treatment means a lot, especially given the stigma attached to [tuberculosis], which stops people getting screened,” he says. “The satisfaction I get from my job is that I wake up every morning knowing that I will make a difference in someone’s life. Without Find and Treat I wouldn’t be here talking to you.”Get in touch with your news tips and stories by filling in our encrypted form below.

       "  'School and university students all over the world are planning to take school strikes one step further and occupy our campuses to demand the end of the fossil economy. Taking a lesson from student activists in the 1960s, the climate justice movement’s youth will shut down business as usual. Not because we don’t like learning, but because what we’ve learned already makes it clear that, without a dramatic break from this system, we cannot ensure a livable planet for our presents and futures.Why occupy? Because we’ve marched. We’ve launched petitions. We’ve written open letters. We’ve had meetings with governments, boards and commissions. We’ve struck. We’ve filled squares, streets and avenues with thousands and, all together, millions of people in continents across this Earth. We’ve screamed with all our lungs. Some of us have even participated in blockades, sit-ins and die-ins. And just as it seemed the seed for deep and radical social transformation was taking root in the midst of the massive 2019 climate mobilizations, Covid-19 came, and our momentum drastically decreased. What didn’t decrease, however, was the greenhouse gas emissions, the exploitation of the global south and the unimaginable profits hoarded by the fossil fuel industry.It’s no secret that our enemy, the fossil fuel industry, rules the world. And it is far from falling; in fact, it is stronger than ever. Proof is a recent investigation by the Guardian that revealed to the world that the fossil fuel empire has 195 “carbon bomb” projects that threaten our hope for a global warming of up to 1.5C, the safe barrier. That’s right: despite our politicians’ and institutions’ indeed hilarious show at Cop26 in 2021, the biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m on planetary destruction projects every day for the rest of the decade.What’s more, the climate crisis is not a fair crisis. The latest IPCC reports show that the ones who are most affected by climate change are often the ones who have done the least in causing it in the first place. As young people born right at the edge of the biggest catastrophe in human history, it is our historic responsibility to rise up to stop it.So, what do we do? Since giving in to defeatism will never be an option for us, we must now organize at a massive scale. We need to create a new peak of mobilization, even bigger than 2019. If we were waiting for a sign, this is it. With temperatures climbing faster and faster, we have never been so certain that mobilizing bigger than ever is not only possible, but existentially necessary.We cannot repeat previous mistakes. We need to be more disruptive than ever, as that’s our only chance for survival. The youth’s innovation and creativity, combined with a fierce appetite for disruption and liberation, can change the world. As a global generation of students, we need to disrupt business as usual, and start with the spaces where we have the power to mobilize and organize – our schools and universities. Sometimes they are directly implicated in the destruction business, as is the case of the many universities that invest in the fossil fuel industry, such as Oxford, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, McGill, Northwestern, MIT, etc. In other cases, they are indirectly linked to it. They train us for a world that has no future, a world of fossil capitalism. They want us to sit in school and learn as if everything was fine. But the world we are learning for – the world that created the climate crisis – has no future. The big question of our generation, “How do we create a world without climate catastrophe?”, will not be answered by sitting in school.The bottom line is: we can’t keep pretending everything is all right, studying as if the planet wasn’t on fire. As other students did before us – from the students of May of ’68 in France to the Arab spring, from the Chilean Penguin Revolution and Primavera Secundarista in Brazil to Occupy Wall Street, we will stop our business-as-usual lives to show our governments and society that we need to change everything, now. From Lisbon to California, from Peru to Germany and from Madrid to Ivory Coast, we call on young people to get together and organize an international revolutionary generation that can change the system.Between September and December 2022, we will occupy hundreds of schools and universities worldwide to end the fossil economy at the international level under the callout to action “End Fossil: Occupy!”. We invite anyone and everyone to join us and organize occupations in their school or universities, as long as they follow our three principles: youth-led occupation, climate justice framework, and occupy until we win. We will revive the youth movement, create new alliances, radicalize, engage the whole of society to support and occupy, and envision the world we want – where life and not profit is at the center – through this sparking international action moment. We will rise up in justice and liberation to crush the fossil fuel industry. We shall have no doubt: the youth are a revolutionary subject. We will turn the tide, change history, and smash the fossil economy.We are here. We are radical. We are ready to occupy.This open letter was written by youth activists involved in End Fossil: Occupy! and signed by organizers and groups around the worldNot since the gruesome heyday of HIV/Aids has a virus  been such a threat to men who have sex with men. As monkeypox rips through queer communities, particularly in London, the cruel legacy of that pandemic casts an unnerving shadow. Conversations in LGBTQ+ spaces – from Highgate men’s pond in the capital to bars and clubs in urban centres – turn anxiously to this new threat.Those who have had the virus share their experiences: some symptoms mild, others painful and miserable. WhatsApp groups ping with pictures of gay and bisexual men proudly displaying plaster-covered upper arms to confirm they’ve been vaccinated in a flashback to the peak of the national Covid trauma. On the gay hookup app Grindr, some use their profiles to announce they’re abstaining from sexual contact until their scheduled vaccination; in queer clubs, some choose to skip the ritual taking-off of T-shirts, fearing the prolonged skin-on-skin contact of an intimate dance will put them at risk.This is, of course, quite unlike HIV, a virus that has taken the lives of tens of millions globally, and which ravaged gay and bi male communities in the west. We know what monkeypox is, the symptoms are largely mild for most, and an effective vaccine – developed for smallpox – is available in the UK. For a significant period in the 1980s, no one knew what was causing rare illnesses such as Kaposi’s sarcoma among men who have sex with men. Speculation was rife: could it be, for example, the high use of amyl nitrite (or “poppers”) by gay and bi men on club floors and in bedrooms? Larry Kramer’s The Normal Heart, a searing play about that early period, explored the panic as gay and bi men watched their friends suddenly stricken by devastating illnesses and suffering often unbearable deaths, unsure about the cause and whether or when it would be their turn.The brutality of that time feeds into a collective trauma among queer men that, for some, has led to a defensiveness over monkeypox. The response to HIV dripped with stigma: already widespread public hostility to same-sex relations was stirred up by media outlets sensationalising a “gay plague”; “I’d shoot my son if he had Aids, says vicar!” was one Sun headline in 1985; while James Anderton, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police until 1991, denounced gays, drug addicts and sex workers with HIV for “swirling in a human cesspit of their own making”.Victim-blaming centred on a bigoted dislike of gay sex as unnatural and wrong; and, according to the British Social Attitudes survey, public hostility to same-sex relations deepened in the 1980s, only falling back a decade later to what were already depressingly intolerant figures in 1983. Stigma welded itself to the internalised shame that afflicts all too many queer men, made throughout history to feel dirty and even sinful. Today, treatments have turned HIV into a chronic illness with a normal life expectancy, but as Dr Chris Ward, a sexual health and HIV consultant, and British Association of Sexual Health & HIV officer, tells me: “Stigma remains a driving factor behind why some people don’t know their HIV status, don’t test and are thus diagnosed late, and it is that same stigma we need to tackle early on in monkeypox.”As a result, some fear any messaging that emphasises monkeypox’s disproportionate effect on men who have sex with men. But the problem with the HIV/Aids response wasn’t that it was targeted, it’s that it was stigmatised. In the west, this is an illness that has always overwhelmingly disproportionately affected men who have sex with men. It is true that, by 2020, there were slightly more new HIV infections among heterosexuals than gay and bi men, but given there are far more straight people, this still means a much higher proportion of infections in queer men. Infections in straight people are also mostly in specific groups, such as African migrants, who also require tailored, specific messaging.No virus is a heat-seeking missile for the sexual orientation of its host. It simply seeks the most effective routes to use the cells of living organisms to replicate itself. That monkeypox overwhelmingly affects men who have sex with men in the west is an incontrovertible fact: international research finds that 98% of those infected by late June were gay or bi men. Some respond that this is because gay and bi men are more likely to test for STIs: but the research also shows that even when sampling bias is taken into account, it’s clear that men having sex with men are almost exclusively at risk.Why? Because the illness has entered networks of men who enjoy having sex with multiple sexual partners. And here is where avoiding stigmatisation is important. There is nothing wrong with liking sex with lots of other people, including anonymous partners. Sex is a good thing, one of the great pleasures – for most of us, anyway – of our often stressful human existences. Not all gay and bi men like to seek intimacy with strangers for sexual pleasure, but a significant number do. As long as consent is always present, emotional boundaries are respected and precautions are taken, the only problem here is society’s baseless revulsion at men enjoying sex with one another. For some gay men, the defensiveness comes from a fear of being lumped in with supposedly too promiscuous members of their community, whom they blame for causing homophobic stereotyping, rather than focusing their ire on the baseless bigotry of some straight people.In any case, those promoting abstention in response are, at best, misguided – there is no evidence in the history of sexual health that this works, but it certainly helps drive stigma when promoted. “Preaching, lecturing and criticism are not helpful tools in destigmatising any infection, and the targeted messaging and focus need to be more on testing, awareness and vaccine rollouts,” says Ward.Already, service users at STI clinics, where most monkeypox testing is carried out, are reporting fear around stigma, or being forced to disclose their sexuality to employers or relatives because of the need to self-isolate. And the real institutional homophobia isn’t about acknowledging monkeypox as a virus overwhelmingly affecting men who have sex with men: it’s a weak response precisely because a still too stigmatised minority is most at risk. Cuts to public health funding for sexual health services not only means an inadequate response to monkeypox: this new surge in demand is swallowing up scarce resources that are needed for other sexual health services, including HIV prevention.That so many queer men are haunted by a recent traumatic history is understandable, but the lesson of HIV/Aids is that those most at risk should be protected without stigma. We have the means to squash this outbreak: the greatest enemy is fear.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer. Please be aware there may be a short delay in comments appearing on the site.Last week, temperatures crested at 40C (104F) in England, bringing the climate crisis to the fore and spurring a fresh wave of dismay. How is it, despite a steady drumbeat of extreme weather events, a rising tide of public outcry, and growing consensus across the political spectrum, that the world remains so profoundly far from the outer limits of the climate targets considered “safe”?The answer is increasingly located not in climate denial, but in a proliferation of non-solutions advocated by policymakers and business interests with varying degrees of earnestness and good intention, under the umbrella of “green capitalism”. These are proposals sold as urgent, pragmatic tools for cutting emissions or reversing ecosystem loss, but which in fact deliver neither.Take sustainable finance. By some estimates, assets invested with some sort of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria now top $35tn, prompting enthusiastic proclamations that private investors, driven by rational self-interest, are delivering a greener future. For many, it seems one really can “do well by doing good”.Unfortunately, this sense of triumph is based on little foundation. To begin with, criticisms of “greenwashing”, in which corporations and financial firms mislead customers and clients on the ecological or social credentials of their products, abound. But the problem cuts much more deeply than a few bad actors who bend the (typically voluntary) rules. Instead, the underlying motivation of ESG investing is not necessarily to achieve the “real world” positive outcomes. Rather the goal is to minimise exposure to risks – whether climate regulation or labour disputes – that could eat into financial returns.For this reason, many ESG funds hardly differ from “mainstream” funds and indices like the S&P 500 (the basket of the 500 largest US corporations). Vanguard’s flagship US ESG fund, for example, has its top holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Tesla edges in at number six, followed by two different share classes of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).It would be hard to argue that many of these would be the companies springing to mind when imagining investment in a decarbonised and ecologically thriving future. Nor do some of them have particularly sterling records when it comes to the “social” pillar of the ESG acronym, whether accusations of human rights abuses and forced labour in supply chains or allegedly illegal surveillance of workers.Moreover, while many might reasonably expect a major ESG fund to be investing in the urgent transition to renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure, instead, more than 40% of the Vanguard fund is allocated to tech and financials. Energy and utilities, occupied by many of the firms we might imagine are at the heart of decarbonisation, together make up less than 1%. Importantly, this appears to be the rule, not the exception.While some specialist firms use their shareholding position to earnestly pressure companies to change their business models or allocate capital to upstart clean energy firms, much of the industry is interested not in directly financing a sustainable future but in ensuring their portfolios are aligned with one. In this sense, ESG can be much better understood as a means of betting on the likelihood of a greener, more sustainable future, rather than helping to build it.Indeed, in one particularly striking study, researchers found the strongest trait differentiating social-themed funds from their mainstream counterparts was investment in companies with relative lack of employees. From the perspective of minimising risks to private investors, this is perfectly logical: no labourers, no labour issues. From the perspective of driving positive social outcomes, it’s hardly cause for celebration.The logic underlying sustainable finance is a problem for the argument that markets are advancing a greener, kinder capitalism. Indeed, the trouble for green capitalism is that its proposed solutions strain to force the complexity of the climate and ecological crises into the narrow frame of “the market”, irrespective of whether the market is a viable arena for confronting them. As a result, these “solutions” are increasingly proving to be anything but.The imprint of green capitalism can be seen in everything from a fixation on carbon markets to the proliferation of ideas like “ecosystem services” and “natural capital”, which seek to divide ecosystems into discrete “stocks” that provide services to the economy. By this logic, a whale is valuable insofar as it captures carbon and impresses tourists. To many, the idea might seem absurd, but with $40bn in ecosystem service trading in 2018 alone, these concepts are increasingly mainstream.Claims of the scale of finance committed to net zero are not curtailing the trillions funnelled every year to the fossil fuel industry. Worldwide, despite some 23% of emissions falling under carbon pricing schemes, the impact of such schemes on overall emissions falls woefully short of IPCC targets. And despite glossy images of oil majors’ “nature-based solutions” and tens of billions in annual trading in ecosystem services, biodiversity continues to decline at staggering rates.We live in a society structured and defined by market relations, and the idea that market-based solutions are the best, most pragmatic, and often only path to resolving most problems is powerfully ingrained common sense. It is, admittedly, difficult to imagine an alternative. It is also urgent and necessary. The siren song of easy win-win solutions to unprecedentedly complex and systemic crises is powerful, but must be resisted. Adrienne is the author The Value of a Whale: on the illusions of green capitalism, and incoming Director of Research at Common WealthOn 28 April, the Nationality and Borders Act passed, taking an axe to Britain’s international legal obligations to refugees. This came just after we marked 10 years of the hostile environment, the set of policies introduced by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012 – albeit trailed by New Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2007 – that saw immigration checks outsourced to trusted public services, and the creation of a surveillance infrastructure to check people’s entitlements and target migrants for removal. Despite the revelations of the Windrush scandal, the hostile environment endures; in the recent Tory leadership contest, all candidates were unanimous in their support for deporting refugees to Rwanda.And this hostility isn’t unique to the UK. Day in and day out, we see the global impact of racialised border violence. Scores of migrants found dead in the back of a trailer truck in Texas. People beaten by the authorities and left for dead in the Spanish enclave of Melilla. Rescue ships in the Mediterranean unable to find a safe port. Refugees on the Greek border coerced by police into pushing back their compatriots.Pushbacks, vigilantism and mass deportations are only the most extreme manifestation of restrictive citizenship and immigration policies designed to police and control national borders.But even as borders proliferate, resistance to them grows. In recent months, people have come together to prevent immigration raids in Glasgow, Edinburgh and London; others lay down at Colnbrook detention centre to stop the first mass deportation flight to Rwanda.These movements demand not piecemeal reform or friendlier border guards, but often the abolition of borders altogether. We can do much more than defend an indefensible status quo.Abolition is a concept we take from movements committed to prison and police abolition. For decades, activists have grappled with some simple truths. Policing and prisons do a lot to punish the poor, little to prevent or reduce violence, and enact much social harm in and of themselves, all at great expense. So they ask: what if rather than locking people up we transformed the original conditions to which policing and prisons are a response? What if people were given the resources they need to live flourishing lives, rather than responding to harm with more harm?We want to apply this framework to borders. What we call border abolition is most concerned with expanding the freedom to move and to stay. This does not mean advocating for free movement in the world as it is now configured, but rather for transformation of the conditions to which borders are a response. Abolition is concerned with presence: the presence of life-sustaining goods, services and practices of care. And it is concerned with absence: of violent state practices such as detention and deportation. In a world like this, borders would become obsolete.Even if we don’t know exactly what a borderless world would look like, there is a vast array of changes we can make in the here and now to reduce the reach and harm of immigration controls, opening the way to a borderless world in the future. As prison abolitionist and educator Mariame Kaba tells us, “Hope is a discipline.” We need not look far to see how the fractures in our present might open the way to radically different, flourishing futures.Rather than simply trying to make more and more people eligible for citizenship, we should recoup the humanity of the non-citizen, and ensure universal access to essential services regardless of immigration status. We should scrap laws that criminalise undocumented migrants for working, renting and driving. We should keep up the fight to end immigration detention, raids and mass deportation flights, which would improve conditions for all non-citizens.Of course, borders necessarily mediate relationships across countries, not simply within them, and so our agenda must be international too. We should agitate for all of the resources expended on border policing – the drones, surveillance watchtowers, armed guards, biometric recognition systems, data-mining tools – to be redirected in service of human flourishing. We should end the many development and aid programmes that enlist governments in the global south to prevent people from migrating in the first place.We should defund Frontex, the EU’s coordinated border force, and instead invest in global solidarity funds to enable the people and states in the global south to better mitigate climate catastrophe. We should support ongoing demands for debt cancellation and an end to arms exports. We should encourage the expansion of bilateral or regional free movement agreements.We do not have to accept the necessity of mass surveillance and mass death in the name of nation and territory. To paraphrase the scholar and activist Mike Davis, we have seen social miracles in our lifetimes, wins that seemed impossible until they weren’t. Many more are possible. Perhaps one of the great rallying cries of May 1968 sets out the task most succinctly: “Let’s be realistic, demand the impossible!”Gracie Mae Bradley and Luke de Noronha are the authors of Against Borders: The Case for Abolition Yesterday morning, Rachel Reeves was drawn into stating on the Today programme that a Labour government would not bring rail, energy and water into public ownership. Then followed a number of tweets from Labour’s shadow transport ministers, reaffirming the party’s commitment to nationalising the railway. By the afternoon, Keir Starmer had confirmed that rail would indeed be brought into public ownership because this was “pragmatic”, but water and energy would not.While Starmer claims the pragmatism of the policy rests on the fact that some of the rail network is already in public hands, the more relevant issue is that Labour is terrified of buying back assets. Bringing contracts (like rail franchises) into public ownership when they come to an end is generally cost-free whereas buying back water and energy companies involves compensating shareholders – and Jeremy Corbyn was hammered for this in the 2019 election.Of course, if Labour brings the whole railway into public ownership and funds it properly, that will be a huge cause for celebration. Privatisation has utterly failed and wastes £1bn a year. The best railway in Europe is publicly owned, in Switzerland.It could go further. If Labour’s rule is that public ownership is fine if it’s cost-free, why not set up a publicly owned energy supply company to compete in the market and offer people a better deal on their energy bills (as French EDF is doing right now)? The government has propped up Bulb at great cost when it could instead have created a new public supplier and transferred its 1.7 million customers. When smaller suppliers failed, they could be absorbed into this company.It could go further still. Why not set up a publicly owned renewable generation company to drive forward water and wind energy, while creating jobs and boosting the economy? The Norwegian state owns Statkraft, the largest renewables generator in Europe and is considering setting up a state-owned hydrogen company. Denmark owns 50% of Ørsted (previously Dong Energy), the world’s largest developer of offshore wind power.Creating an energy supplier and a renewable generation company could be done at very little cost, and would be a pragmatic way to use public ownership to tackle the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis.But by awkwardly dodging discussion of buying back water and energy grids, when recent polling shows a majority of “red wall” voters believe they belong in public hands, Labour is missing an opportunity.The privatised English water monopolies have spewed sewage into our rivers and seas, killing fish and making children ill wand allow 900 Olympic swimming pools worth of water a day to leak away, racking up a debt mountain, paying CEOs millions and allowing 900 Olympic swimming pools worth of water a day to leak away because they’d rather not spend money on investing in infrastructure. Meanwhile, they return around £2bn a year to shareholders, pay their CEOs millions and rack up a debt mountain at our expense. Scottish Water has spent £72 a year extra per household on infrastructure because it’s in public ownership.The energy grid monopolies have extremely high profits, and have similarly been slow to invest in infrastructure. Bringing energy transmission and distribution into public hands would save about £3.7bn a year.It’s understandable that Labour is scared to talk about this. But bringing these assets into public hands would be a brilliant deal for the public purse. Every household in the country could benefit, and so would local economies.Parliament can judge what is in the public interest and decide how much compensation would be appropriate. It seems reasonable to compensate shareholders for the money they originally invested, rather than the current market value of shares. The policy would pay for itself in around seven years on that basis.Would this hurt our pensions? Absolutely not. Our water companies and energy networks are primarily owned by shareholders abroad. Wessex Water, for example, is owned by a Malaysian company, and Northumbrian Water is 80% owned by Li Ka Shing, a Hong Kong businessman. Only 8.5% of the water sector is owned by UK pensions. Northern Powergrid which provides electricity to the North East, is owned by Warren Buffett. UK Power Networks, covering London, is also owned by Li Ka Shing. Only 8.5% of the water sector is owned by UK pensions. US billionaire Warren Buffett owns Northern Powergrid, which provides electricity to north-east England. Li Ka-shing, a Hong Kong businessman owns UK Power Networks, covering London. Only 2% of our energy is owned by UK pensions.How about really taking back control, having water and energy companies that work for the British public and protecting pensions as needed while we do it? England’s model of selling off water assets wholesale is unique and the UK is almost the only country in Europe to have a privatised energy grid.Reeves has already committed to £28bn of green investment a year. Bringing water and energy into public ownership would also be an investment, giving the government tools to cut bills, connect up community renewables to the grid, upgrade infrastructure to stop leaks and clean up rivers and seas.People want decent public transport. They also want affordable energy bills and rivers that aren’t filled with sewage. Taking back our national assets is not only pragmatic, it’s a vote winner.Cat Hobbs is the founder of We Own It, an organisation that campaigns for public ownership of public servicesOn Saturday, I did my local parkrun. For the unfamiliar, that means I walked to my local park and ran around it for 5km with about 100 other people, cheered on by volunteers who were cheering for nothing and who had set it up for nothing.I should have been delighted: this was my first run since I got Covid two weeks ago. The sun was shining, the park at Potternewton in Leeds is beautiful. Instead, I watched a lithe and fit-looking woman running in front of me and thought: “I’d like to run like her.” And then corrected myself. No, I’d like to run like me. The fitter, faster version of me from 2019, when I got personal bests in every race I did and was at peak health.Throughout lockdowns I did not waver: living room HIIT workouts, regular running and yoga. Then this year I got four months of long Covid, a month of health and another bout of Covid. My metrics on Strava are going down, not up.Mentioning races and personal bests are two clues that I am not the majority. Half of women in the UK have done no vigorous exercise in the past 12 months, according to a survey of 8,000 people by the Healthier Nation Index. That is no vigorous exercise, no half-hearted moving: just nothing.One in three women said their fitness had declined over the past 12 months; that when the gyms shut, so did their motivation, and it hasn’t come back. The NHS would like adults to do 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week (that includes walking, cycling, inline skating and pushing a lawnmower) or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise (where you can’t say a few words without pausing for breath). It also wants us to do two weight-bearing sessions a week. Add this to all the endless head-scratching and hectoring about food and drink (butter good; butter bad. Red wine healthy; red wine lethal), and I can sympathise with the 47% of women surveyed who found it easier to give up exercising altogether.That may not be the true picture. Sport England’s annual Active Lives Survey, last released in November 2021, surveyed nearly 100,000 women and found that 59% did 150 minutes of exercise a week. Only 27.9% were inactive. It’s likely that many women exercise informally – running around after children, doing the lion’s share of housework and care work, as was definitely the case during the pandemic. But current rates of obesity – which have risen from 6% of men and 9% of women in 1980 to 27%-29% now – suggest otherwise.What is the answer? There isn’t a single solution. Here are the usual: join a club or organise to exercise with a friend or two. I would not get half the enjoyment I do out of fell running without my fell running clubmates and friends. Find a sport you enjoy and you will make time for it. Busy people will balk at making time, so the answer is to use the time you’re already using. Even five minutes a day of exercise that raises the heart rate is good for you: those hackneyed messages about getting off a bus stop earlier, or taking the stairs, are old but good.Cycling to work instead of sitting in a car or a bus, of course, is a great idea, and you need to get there anyway. But that only works if cyclists feel safe. In Leeds, where I live, my regular cycle route involves at least two near-misses with idiot drivers who cut me up, though I wear so much hi-vis and have so many lights a woman once wound down her window at me on a dark winter’s night and said: “What are you, a Christmas tree?” I look wistfully at cycle lanes in the Netherlands that are extensive and separate from the road. But investment in cycling is still pitiful (Leeds’ network of dedicated cycle paths has improved, but it was a low bar).What else? Inspiration. But how are women meant to get inspiration when newspaper sports pages still, largely, think they are invisible? Men have had a Tour de France for 119 years. Women were allowed one for five years in the 1980s, and only allowed one again this year (it started on Sunday). At the opening game of Women’s Euro 2022 at Old Trafford, the sight of thousands of young girls in the stands was far more invigorating than the match.Finally, trickery. I know what it feels like to lose your fitness and feel out of shape, and how that can seem like an obstacle rather than a challenge. So trick your brain in small ways: I have trained mine to think it’s weird not to do single leg squats when I clean my teeth. I get up from my desk at 45-minute intervals to do squats. Sports strategists talk of marginal gains, which could be anything from changing mealtimes to an afternoon nap. A toothbrushing squat may not seem like much, but marginal gains add up to major ones. You may be starting small but small is better than the sofa.Rose George is the author of Nine Pints: A journey through the miraculous, mysterious world of bloodDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

       "  \"When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, landed in Yaoundé, Cameroon, on Monday for a two-day visit, France’s puppet leaders across Africa were assured of one thing: Françafrique is back. The question is what this means for the future of millions.The answer – and Macron’s legacy – is more repression, more coups, more corruption, more violence, more suffering and, ultimately, more refugees and migrants making dangerous journeys to Europe in search of safety. It will also mean the further incursion of Russia and China, which highlight European colonial crimes even as they ramp up their own influence.Born after the independence of France’s former colonies in Africa, Macron presents himself as the antithesis to Françafrique – the doctrine that dictates the terms of governance in former French colonies, by military force if necessary – or, as I see it, Colonisation 2.0.Rather than abolish it, Macron reformed the colonial CFA franc – originally franc des colonies françaises d’Afrique – a currency still printed in France and used by 14 African countries. It will be renamed the Eco by 2027, sparking accusations of neo-colonisation, including by Italy’s then-deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio.To regain credibility, Macron agreed to return some of the African artefacts looted under colonialism in French museums, and to declassify secret files on the assassination in 1987 of Burkina Faso’s anti-colonial leader Thomas Sankara. He commissioned a report that criticised the former French president François Mitterrand over actions around the Rwandan genocide, agreed to return the skulls of 24 Algerian resistance fighters taken to France in the 19th century as trophies, and – as the diplomatic lead for all things related to French-speaking Africa at the UN security council – Macron also pledged to stand up for democracy and protect human rights.Yet Macron’s first foreign trip outside Europe since re-election in April will see him meet Paul Biya, an 89-year-old despot who has been in power since Macron was five years old.Over the weekend the Élysée Palace said Macron was meeting Biya not to find a solution to Cameroon’s anglophone crisis, which has seen separatist militias and government forces committing human rights abuses with impunity for the past five years, but to discuss the food crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, agriculture and security issues.Notably absent from the Élysée’s reasons for the visit are Biya’s human rights abuses, including the persecution of LGBT people.No justification for Macron’s visit can erase the fact that Paris is still the bedrock for Françafrique and its puppets – such as Alassane Ouattara, in Ivory Coast; Ali Bongo Ondimba, in Gabon; Faure Gnassingbé, in Togo; Gen Mahamat Déby, in Chad; Denis Sassou Nguesso, in Congo-Brazzaville; as well as Biya – that France shelters under its security and diplomatic umbrella despite their gross abuses of human rights, corruption and electoral fraud that have impoverished their countries.Take Chad, where one in three – or 6.1 million people – need humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. When Idriss Déby, in power for 30 years, died from wounds sustained in combat last year, Macron said France had “lost a brave friend,” and endorsed his 37-year-old son, Mahamat, who dissolved the government and declared himself president, in violation of Chad’s constitution, before his father was even buried.In Cameroon, the situation is dire. As Africa’s largest timber producer and the world’s fifth-largest cocoa producer, the country should be prosperous. Instead, Biya’s ruthlessly authoritarian regime has made it one of the world’s poorest, ranking 153 out of 189 countries in the 2020 Human Development Index. More than half of the 26 million population were “food insecure” long before soaring global commodity prices made it harder for families to put food on the table.Add to this the codification of violence against women under Biya. According to Cameroon’s civil code, only men can be the heads of households, only men can choose the place of residence, and men and women do not have equal property rights.In the penal code, adultery is always punishable if committed by a woman, but is only punishable when committed by a man if it is “habitual” or takes place in the matrimonial home. Abortion is criminalised, unless the mother’s life is in danger or if pregnancy is the result of rape – and rape is not a crime within marriage.Macron, of course, knows all of this, but it seems what matters most is still Françafrique.Vava Tampa is a freelance writer, focusing on Africa’s Great Lakes region, decolonisation and cultureStress was written all over Sunman Senthilnathan’s face as he left the pharmacy with the crucial medicine that brings him, every two months, to Sri Lanka’s commercial capital, Colombo.He was diagnosed with colon cancer three years ago, and the 56-year-old’s treatment has dominated his life ever since. Now it is even more difficult to deal with during the crippling economic crisis in Sri Lanka that has caused fuel, food and medicine shortages and major political upheaval.Like others with long-term illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension, Senthilnathan has struggled during the crisis to find – and to afford – his medication. The coping methods are drastic: cutting or completely missing out on medication or cutting out meals and changing diets to save money.“Prices keep increasing and drugs are unaffordable. There are no cheaper substitutes so I have given up on some drugs,” says Senthilnathan, who survives on his pension. He takes a reduced dosage of the drugs he does manage to buy.The human toll of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is huge and rising. These illnesses end the lives of approximately 41 million of the 56 million people who die every year – and three quarters of them are in the developing world.NCDs are simply that; unlike, say, a virus, you can’t catch them. Instead, they are caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors. The main types are cancers, chronic respiratory illnesses, diabetes and cardiovascular disease – heart attacks and stroke. Approximately 80% are preventable, and all are on the rise, spreading inexorably around the world as ageing populations and lifestyles pushed by economic growth and urbanisation make being unhealthy a global phenomenon.NCDs, once seen as illnesses of the wealthy, now have a grip on the poor. Disease, disability and death are perfectly designed to create and widen inequality – and being poor makes it less likely you will be diagnosed accurately or treated.Investment in tackling these common and chronic conditions that kill 71% of us is incredibly low, while the cost to families, economies and communities is staggeringly high.In low-income countries NCDs – typically slow and debilitating illnesses – are seeing a fraction of the money needed being invested or donated. Attention remains focused on the threats from communicable diseases, yet cancer death rates have long sped past the death toll from malaria, TB and HIV/Aids combined.'A common condition' is a new Guardian series reporting on NCDs in the developing world: their prevalence, the solutions, the causes and consequences, telling the stories of people living with these illnesses.Tracy McVeigh, editorHe says he has already had to cut both quantity and quality of his food because scarcity of certain drugs is driving prices higher. “Each month, prices increase, and soon my pension will have to be spent on medicine.”Sri Lanka imports about 80% of its drugs. Nearly 200 of them, mainly used by cancer and kidney patients, are in short supply, with knock-on delays in the scheduling of “non-urgent” surgeries.Sri Lanka’s Rajapaksa ruling dynasty drove the island to economic disaster by amassing international debt to fund showy infrastructure projects, which were associated with corruption. As the global cost of living crisis hit, Sri Lanka’s lack of foreign resources has meant blackouts, queues at fuel stations and people having to skip meals. Immigration office have been inundated as people try to get out to find work abroad.Beverton Rayan, a teacher from Colombo with type 1 diabetes, says he is now spending about 20,000 Sri Lankan rupees (£46) a month on insulin alone, more than double previously, and has had to wait up to three days for the medication to be available. “For people on an even lower income than me, it can be a matter of life and death,” he says.Rayan has managed to continue his medical regime by borrowing from his parents. But now he needs more. The spiralling cost of food has meant giving up on a low-carbohydrate high-protein diet. “Now I just eat whatever,” he says. “When I was on the lower calorie diet I used to dose lower in insulin, so not only is food more expensive but since I’m eating more calories I have to take more insulin … which is already more expensive anyway. It’s an endless loop of hell.”Swarna Gamlath, 49, a patient of the cardiology clinic at a public hospital in Western Province, says they do not have the drugs she needs, but she cannot afford to buy them from the pharmacy as prices have trebled. She recently had to skip a whole month of her prescription for blood-thinning drugs. “I was put on drugs for life, and now I take one dose a day, not two, as prescribed.“The only solution I could see was to just have the morning dosage. I was hoping for a slightly longer goodbye, for the sake of my children, but now it’s likely to be faster and far more painful.”Senthilnathan has decided to try to replace his drugs with traditional medicines but has little confidence in his future. “I don’t even know if it’s going to work, but now I am taking treatment. It’s my last chance. “I think my days are numbered. A friend of mine who was a cancer patient died during the Covid pandemic because he could not undergo lifesaving surgery at that time. I had to postpone my tests due to a shortage in medical supplies, increasing my vulnerability to infection. “I am on death row. Every time I curl up in pain, I fear for the future of my two daughters who are still studying. I cannot go overseas for treatment so I’d be left to die.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:\"),\n",

Germany crashed out in the quarter-finals in 2017, ending their 22-year reign as champions, and they want their crown back. But France have a taste of Euros glory and are hungry for more.France have reached a Euros semi-finals for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 1-0. They had to battle for the win with overdespite having more than 30 shots, and only an Ève Périsset penalty in extra time put them through. Germany beat Austria 2-0 in 90 minutes and played two days before France, meaning they could have a fitness advantage.Germany are the favourites, particularly as they are the only team left not to have conceded a goal, but they are not underestimating France. “France are very strong opponents who have deservedly reached the semi-final,” said Germany’s Lena Lattwein. “They have incredible individual quality and a lot of pace in attack. But when it comes to defence, especially how they deal with losing the ball, there will be spaces and opportunities for us. I’m looking forward to an even contest.”Germany will be forced into one change after their forward Klara Bühl tested positive for Covid, with Linda Dallmann a strong contender to replace her.Germany (4-3-3): Frohms; Gwinn, Hegering, Hendrich, Rauch; Oberdorf, Däbritz, Magull; Huth, Dallmann, Popp.\\xa0France (4-3-3): Peyraud-Magnin; Périsset, Renard, Tounkara, Karchaoui; Geyoro, Bilbault, Mateo; Cascarino, Diani, Malard.France will just be glad to have the focus back on the football. Before the tournament the squad were making headlines for all the wrong reasons. Rumours of bad blood between the team and the manager, Corinne Diacre, and with big names such as Amandine Henry left out of the squad many believed they would not go far.They blew those discussions out of the water in their first game against Italy. Grace Geyoro became the first player to score a first-half hat-trick at a women’s Euros and they were the first in the tournament’s history to score five goals before half-time. The attention soon shifted. France have also had to rally around each other after their top striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto suffered an ACL injury in the group stage. Any grievances have been put to one side. Diacre said: “This team gives absolutely everything. They kept plugging away and they kept loyal to our gameplan … We’re here to build history. The players and the staff want to make history for ourselves.”If Germany win they will have the chance to extend their record Euros titles. They have claimed the trophy eight times from the 12 past tournaments. And it is not just team history that could be in the making, with Germany’s Alexandra Popp close to cementing herself as a Euros legend.Popp, who started on the bench in the first match but has secured her place in the starting XI, is competing at her first Euros after injuries meant she missed out on the previous two. She has scored in four consecutive matches, equalling the record set by her compatriot Heidi Mohr.France have their own ones to watch, particularly the captain, Wendie Renard, and Delphine Cascarino. Renard was unlucky to not get on the scoresheet, with an impressive save by the Netherlands goalkeeper, Daphne van Domselaar, keeping her out, but she has presented a deadly threat at set pieces. Her Lyon teammate Cascarino has recorded player of the match performances, with her tactical runs around the penalty area unlocking defences.So will the European giants get back to their main stage of a Euros final or will the new kids on the block defy the odds? Whatever the outcome all eyes will be on Milton Keynes for what is billed to be a match for the ages.The race for the Women’s Euro 2022 Golden Boot will be fascinating, with so many great goalscorers taking part in England.Norway’s Ada Hegerberg will be one of the favourites, having returned to the international fold after a five-year absence while her Scandinavian colleagues Pernille Harder (Denmark) and Stina Blackstenius (Sweden) are also in with a shout.The hosts could rely on the goals of Ellen White and Beth Mead among others to go far in the tournament, while Lauren Hemp is expected to be high in the table for assists.Other names to look out for are the Netherlands’ Vivianne Miedema, France’s Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Germany’s Alexandra Popp, with Spain’s Clàudia Pina an outside bet.

Read the team guide here.This Germany team are a strong collective and have many technically good and tactically astute midfielders who can run the game. And there is speed on the wings too.

Read the team guide here.This squad has a lot of experience and at the World Cup in 2019 the defence was one of the best at the tournament, not conceding a goal in open play in five games. There is a certain lack of physicality in the squad and the fact is that Serie A is not at the same level as the other top leagues in Europe. Set pieces could be a problem too. Guardian writers’ predicted position: 16th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position: 13thOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 750-1Second-season syndrome? Brentford arguably suffered a variant of it in their first. After storming through the opening weeks of their Premier League debut they slumped alarmingly to the extent that, had it not been for the transformative impact of Christian Eriksen, relegation would have loomed menacingly. It means they have experience of pulling themselves up by the bootstraps when opponents find them out and the signs are they may need to draw upon it.The obvious snag is that Eriksen, who protractedly chose Manchester United ahead of another spell in west London, is no longer around. Brentford need a different route to safety, freshening up in the right areas while retaining most of the formula that has served them so admirably. They will be boosted if Ivan Toney, one of the league’s most impressive leaders of the line, is still around after the transfer window closes but he will need help. The versatile Keane Lewis-Potter has arrived from Hull and, at 21, excites with his potential and ability to contribute goals from out wide; he will compete with Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, two similarly lavish talents who will hope to find more consistent end product this time.There is a sense that a string-puller behind those front men would make all the difference, though, with guile in modest supply once again. Thomas Frank has at least been able to toughen up the rest of the squad: Ben Mee brings proven ability and experience in central defence and the highly rated young Scotland international Aaron Hickey could solve a full-back problem while Thomas Strakosha is a high-quality alternative in goal. Few recruit more cannily than Brentford and they will need to show it again if their campaign is to be smooth.There are few Premier League managers as charming as Frank, a generous character whose press conferences can stretch on forever. That is not to say he is a consistent source of material: the 48-year-old perfected the “we’re just a bus stop in Hounslow” early last season and is famed for his “No dickheads” policy but tends to steer clear of real controversy. Although not a spring chicken there is a sense he may yet climb higher and his name has been mentioned vaguely in connection with vacancies elsewhere. But the urbane Frank appears content with his lot and Brentford are certainly delighted with him. It has been a happy fit since he stepped up to replace Dean Smith in 2018, and the sense of forward momentum has rarely let up. Maintaining that in 2022-23 could be his biggest feat yet: 13th place last season was an excellent finish and an improvement this time would require a sprinkling of magic.Hickey was linked with a number of clubs, including Arsenal, before arriving on a four-year contract from Bologna. He turned 20 in June but made almost 50 appearances in Serie A since signing from Hearts in 2020 in a high-profile deal made more notable by the fact he rejected a rival offer from Bayern Munich. Last season Hickey scored five goals, adding to the sense that he is a modern, dynamic attacking full-back who will fit the Bees’ style well. He can operate on either flank and may find himself deployed on the right, where options were few last term.Four of Brentford’s squad could be called up for Denmark, although Mathias Jensen and Christian Norgaard are the only two likely to travel at this point. Beyond that, the Bees get off lightly and most of the side can enjoy an early winter break. Saman Ghoddos should be in Iran’s squad to face England and midfielder Frank Onyeka has a strong chance of being picked by Nigeria.The London Museum of Water and Steam – something the Bees hope not to run out of this season – is a three-minute walk from the stadium, although bear in mind it opens only at weekends. It is located in an old Victorian waterworks and, to stretch another metaphor, Brentford will not want too many of those from their fanbase at the campaign’s end.The club’s commercial department will mourn Eriksen’s departure: his arrival shattered their previous records, with demand for shirts bearing his name said to have increased by 30 times and punters from around the globe placing orders. Toney is the leading man in his absence, along with the likes of Jansson and Norgaard. If Lewis-Potter begins well then the letters from a 12-figure surname might put a few more pounds in the Bees’ bank account; this season’s chart topper, though, is still to be revealed.Toney was forced into more of a social climbdown last winter when a video posted on Twitter showed him saying “Fuck Brentford”. He apologised and the matter was forgotten, as much of anything put into the ether can be. Things could have been worse: most of Brentford’s players have relatively modest followings, with Toney’s 150,000 fanbase on Instagram small beer compared with his colleagues at top clubs. New addition Mee has an even lower-profile but articulate social media presence, offering a refreshing earthiness.It would require a Danish twist, perhaps with pale lighting, Anglo-Saxon language and an ominous The Killing-style soundtrack whenever things start to go awry. If that idea does not fly, the angular Brentford Community Stadium is so cutely crammed into a seemingly impossible knot of space off the M4 that a design-related theme would surely play well.The Dane, in tears of despair after crashing and losing time on stage two, was in tears again, but this time of joy after her explosive acceleration took her clear of Vos in the last 100m. It is hard to imagine a more exuberant winner in the long history of the Tour de France.“It feels like a such a good comeback after what, I have to say, was a fucking shit day yesterday,” the 26-year-old FDJ Suez rider said, emphatically. “I just love how the team kept the fighting spirit and we knew that today was a super-good day [for us].“If I had the legs, I could try and go for the win, but to actually do it and be a Tour de France stage winner, in this Danish national champion’s jersey – hh my God, it just doesn’t get better.”The succession of short, sharp climbs through the hills overlooking Epernay whittled down the lead group on the approach to the sharpest of all, the Côte de Mutigny, 15kms from the finish and famously the platform for Julian Alaphilippe’s spectacular stage win in Epernay, in the 2019 men’s Tour.But Giro Donne winner and pre-race favourite, Annemiek Van Vleuten, again had a fatiguing day, having lost 50 seconds to Vos on stage two and then forced to chase back to the peloton after a mechanical issue with 30kms to race. Worse came on the final climb, Mont Bernon, with pitches as steep as 14%, when she lost contact with the front group of favourites and was forced to pursue alone.Although the Dutch rider chased back to the rear of the select front group, she again lost ground in the sprint, ceding a further 18 seconds to Vos. The 35-year-old Jumbo-Visma leader retained the overall lead from Silvia Persico (Vulcar Travel and Service) and Katarzyna Niewiadoma (Canyon SRAM) by 16 seconds.It’s 2022. Sydney McLaughlin is 22. She crosses the line and sits down on the track. There are no wild celebrations or overt displays of emotion. Maybe she’s simply stunned at the fact that she’s just run a world 400m hurdles final in a time that would have earned seventh place in the final of the 400m flat. Maybe she’s reflecting on the mathematical improbability of lowering the world record from 52.16 to 50.68 in the space of 13 months. Maybe she’s just thinking about the lactic acid still burning inside her legs.At the press conference, the focus is not on what she has just achieved but what she might yet achieve. More world records? The 50-second barrier? A switch of events? The world has seen a miracle, and all it wants to know about is her next trick. “The sky’s the limit, for sure,” she says. “I need to ask my coach about our next goal. He calls the shots.” She doesn’t say what she wants for herself.McLaughlin looks compact, reserved, constrained. They call her a robot, a machine. They roll their eyes when she talks about her faith and dedicates her triumphs to the glory of God. And you remember an interview she gave a long time ago, when she was still a teenager, still a schoolgirl, the point at which her inner and outer worlds were beginning to collapse in on each other. “Whenever I got frustrated,” she said, “I’d go to practice and run it out. Get the stress out on the track. I make it look easier than it is. People don’t see the struggle.”It’s 2016. Sydney is 16. From the moment she could run, running was the fate chosen for her. Her parents were star athletes. So were her brother and sister. She was sent to Union Catholic, where the school fees are $18,000 a year and the expectations are stratospheric. She broke school records and state records, won a place at the prestigious US trials. Now, as she paces gingerly around the warm-up track, something stops her. She doesn’t want to run. She’s having a panic attack. She wants to go home. “I don’t want to do this,” she pleads with her coaches. “I don’t belong here.”Earlier in the year, Sydney had fallen ill with mononucleosis and missed the first six weeks of the season. In April, her mother Mary suffered a heart attack. She worried about what athletics was doing to her social life, that it was becoming less of a hobby and more of a job. And as she crosses the line in third place, having been persuaded to run by her father, all she can feel is relief that it it’s all over and fear at what is to come. Afterwards, a reporter asks about her future plans. “Sleep,” she says. “And sleep again.”It’s 2021. Sydney is 21. Three days ago she broke the world record at the Olympic trials. Now she’s sitting in her car, outside the shops, trying to fight back tears. “I don’t know what’s happening,” she says into her phone camera. “I achieved one of my life’s dreams. And the people who I thought would be most excited didn’t even care.” The rolling tears collect into sobs. “You can do everything right, and it’ll never be enough. There’s always a problem with you.” She pushes her hair out of her face. “It’s a sick world,” she spits into the lens, partly in disdain, partly in despair.It’s 2006. Sydney is six. She’s about to run the 100 metre dash for the first time. Her father Willie tells her that she can have an almond chocolate bar if she wins. She wins. Afterwards she feels emptied, unsatisfied, unsure what the point of it all was. Then her father hands her the chocolate bar. She swirls and crunches the sweet nutty candy around her mouth, and decides there and then to carry on running. The chocolate disappears down her throat, never to be tasted again.The thing that traps you also sets you free. The thing that sets you free also traps you. The path that led Sydney to the start line at Eugene was not entirely of her choosing. Her talent she owes to God. Her athletic genes she owes to her parents. Her technique and consistency she owes to her coaches. Her career and mission she owes to all of them. This is what she wants. This is what makes her happy. But she knows too that she is a project, a plan, a figment of the ambition of others. So she runs. She runs faster and more perfectly than anyone who has ever run before her.It’s 2022. Sydney is 22. This is the most brutal of all the sprint events, a quarter of a mile of pure pain, where every step is a potential disaster. Femke Bol’s blond ponytail flaps against her back. Dalilah Muhammad’s hair dances and weaves in the wind. But Sydney’s hair is trussed so tightly that not a single strand falls out of place.This is what she knows. This is what she does. The hurdles disappear smoothly under her. Bol and Muhammad are nowhere to be seen. The crowd are already loosening their jaws in disbelief. And yet as she nears the tape she seems to slow a little. She’s won, but there’s a reluctance. It’s almost as if she can see the thing she was running from, right there, waiting for her exactly where she started.Griner has acknowledged that she was carrying vape canisters containing cannabis oil when she was arrested in February at a Moscow airport, but she contends that she had no criminal intent and that the canisters ended up in her luggage inadvertently because of hasty packing.“We are not arguing that Brittney took it here as a medicine. We are still saying that she involuntarily brought it here because she was in a rush,” defense attorney Alexander Boykov said after the session in which a Russian neuropsychologist testified about worldwide use of medicinal cannabis.“The Russian public has to know, and the Russian court in the first place has to know, that it was not used for recreational purposes in the United States. It was prescribed by a doctor,” he said.Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist who plays for the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The medical testimony and Griner’s admission that she had the canisters is aimed at bringing her a mild sentence.“We have a lot of mitigating factors. So we do hope that the court will take it into consideration. And the courts in Russia, in fact, have very broad discretion with regard to the sentence,” said Maria Blagovolina, another of Griner’s lawyers.The trial of the two-time Olympic gold medalist began on July 1 but only five sessions have been held, some them lasting only about an hour.The slow-moving trial and Griner’s five months of detention have raised strong criticism among teammates and supporters in the United States, which has formally declared her to be “wrongfully detained,” a designation sharply rejected by Russian officials.Elizabeth Rood, the US embassy’s charge d’affaires, attended Tuesday’s court session. Griner “confirms that she is doing OK and as well as can be expected under these circumstances,” she told reporters.Griner was arrested in February amid heightened US-Moscow tensions ahead of Russia sending troops into Ukraine later that month. Some supporters contend she is being held in Russia as a pawn, possibly for a prisoner swap. US soccer star Megan Rapinoe last week said “she’s being held as a political prisoner, obviously.'’The Russian foreign ministry last week denied the US contention that Griner is being wrongfully detained and said Russian laws should be respected.“If a US citizen was taken in connection with the fact that she was smuggling drugs, and she does not deny this, then this should be commensurate with our Russian local laws, and not with those adopted in San Francisco, New York and Washington,” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.“If drugs are legalized in the United States, in a number of states, and this is done for a long time and now the whole country will become drug-addicted, this does not mean that all other countries are following the same path,'’ she added.Russian media have speculated that Griner could be exchanged for prominent Russian arms trader Viktor Bout, who is imprisoned in the United States, and that Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia for espionage, may also figure in an exchange.US officials have not commented on the prospects for such a trade. Russian officials have said no exchange could be discussed until the conclusion of the legal proceedings against Griner. It is unclear how long the trial will last, but a court has authorized Griner’s detention until 20 December.Previous trial sessions have included character-witness testimony from the director and captain of the Russian team that Griner played for in the off-season, along with written testimony including a doctor’s letter saying he had authorized her to use cannabis for pain treatment.Though Stradivarius got to the front inside the last furlong, Kyprios kept finding more and got his head back in front in the last 200 yards to hold on for a neck victory.The pair finished just ahead of Trueshan, who was given the chance to defend his crown by trainer Alan King and the six-year-old ran a bold race in bidding to win back-to-back renewals, finishing a length and a quarter back in third.The Goodwood crowd were willing Stradivarius to a fifth success in the long-distance Group One event but while it wasn’t to be, race fans were rewarded afterwards when owner Bjorn Nielsen confirmed his eight-year-old veteran would carry on racing.He said: “I was happy with the way Stradivarius ran. I thought half a furlong out he might do it but it was hard to see at the angle and if he had been upsides it might have been a different story.“We’re not going to say goodbye after that. He still has his enthusiasm and he’s run the Gold Cup winner very close. York [for the Yorkshire Cup] is on the cards. Frankie handled him well there but I haven’t discussed [whether he will be back on the horse] with the trainer.”Usual jockey Frankie Dettori was taken off after he had a troubled passage for the second year running at Royal Ascot in the Gold Cup.Andrea Atzeni, who was on board on Tuesday, said: “He ran his heart out again. Maybe he got a bit lonely on his own but he is a true champion.”Winning rider Ryan Moore holds the winner – who at one stage in his life was seen as a Classic contender – in very high regard. “Today is only his eighth race and he is only doing what he has to do,” he said.“It was a steadily-run race and he was in front a long way out. He was just waiting. I always feel I’m not going to the bottom of him.“He is a proper Group One horse and Aidan has always had a lot of belief in the horse. At the start of the year he was saying what he thought he could do, so all credit to him and the team at home for getting him back.” Tony PaleyWith Baaeed sure to set off at prohibitive odds for the Sussex Stakes on the second afternoon at Glorious Goodwood, the Group Three Oak Tree Stakes makes more appeal from a betting perspective as 17 fillies and mares are due to go to post and the market is struggling to find a favourite.Heredia and Soft Whisper are the obvious candidates, and the former’s smooth success in the Sandringham Handicap at Royal Ascot is the strongest piece of recent form on offer.Richard Hannon’s filly surrendered her unbeaten record when odds-on at Sandown Park 15 days later, however, and while she was possibly feeling the effects of three races in quick succession, punters can be forgiven for wondering if a 25-day break is enough to freshen her up.As a result, the steadily-progressive Soft Whisper (2.25), a Listed winner last time, makes more appeal at around 9-2. She has a high draw to contend with but Saeed bin Suroor’s filly is the only confirmed front-runner in the field and will be tough to pass if Marco Ghiani can get her out and across towards the rail from stall 16.Goodwood 1.50 Secret State will be a popular choice to follow up his win at the Royal meeting, but he faces several improving and lightly weighted rivals including Soulcombe. William Haggas’s gelding has made short work of his only two handicap starts so far and gets 19lb from the favourite.Goodwood 3.00 The form of this year’s Windsor Castle at Royal Ascot looks rock solid with seven subsequent winners emerging from the race already, including the runner-up, Rocket Rodney. George Scott’s gelding had plenty to spare at Sandown next time up and has useful experience of this test too, having won a novice event over track and trip in April.Goodwood 3.35 Unbeaten Baaeed is head and shoulders above this field on the ratings and has recorded dominant victories over Alcohol Free, Chindit and Order Of Australia already this summer. Modern Games, the French 2,000 Guineas winner, is a fresh opponent but will need to find more than a stone to give Baaeed a race if the favourite is anywhere close to his best.Goodwood 4.10 Rousay has been generally progressive this season and 10-1 is too big a price on her form when runner-up at Salisbury earlier this month.Perth\\n1.00 Leopolds Rock\\n1.35 First Angel\\n2.10 Emirat De Catana\\n2.45 And The New\\n3.20 Lady Babs\\n3.55 Get With It\\n4.30 Say You Say MeGoodwood\\n1.50 Soulcombe (nb)\\n2.25 Soft Whisper (nap)\\n3.00 Rocket Rodney\\n3.35 Baaeed\\n4.10 Rousay\\n4.45 The Platinum Queen\\n5.20 BowmanRedcar\\n2.00 Lakota Blue\\n2.35 Minwah\\n3.10 Forgivable\\n3.45 Million Thanks\\n4.20 Mr Trevor\\n4.55 Amelia R\\n5.30 Mac AileySandown Park\\n5.50 Persian Royal\\n6.20 Byefornow\\n6.50 Starnberg\\n7.25 Aldhaja\\n8.00 Cookies And Creme\\n8.30 Tuddenham GreenLeicester\\n6.00 Serenity Rose\\n6.30 Sassy Redhead\\n7.00 Shamekh\\n7.35 Clipsham Gold\\n8.10 Bearaway\\n8.40 BlackheathGoodwood 4.45 The Platinum Queen had plenty in hand at York last time and should need only to match that form to follow up here. Greg WoodAn international team of experts have issued a global call for further chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) prevention and mitigation efforts to be brought in, especially for children.Researchers from Oxford Brookes University and 12 other academic institutions produced the study, with analysis provided by Concussion Legacy Foundation UK.It found that the brain banks of the US Department of Defence, Boston University-US Department of Veterans Affairs and Mayo Clinic have published independent studies showing contact-sport athletes were at least 68 times more likely to develop CTE than those who did not play any contact sport.Dr Chris Nowinski, the lead author of the study and chief executive at the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said: “This innovative analysis gives us the highest scientific confidence that repeated head impacts cause CTE.“Sport governing bodies should acknowledge that head impacts cause CTE and they should not mislead the public on CTE causation while athletes die, and families are destroyed, by this terrible disease.”Dr Adam White, senior lecturer in sport and coaching sciences at Oxford Brookes University and executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation UK, said: “This analysis shows it is time to include repetitive head impacts and CTE among other child safety efforts like smoking, sunburns and alcohol.“Repetitive head impacts and CTE deserve recognition in the global public health discussion of preventable disorders caused by childhood exposure in contact sports like football, rugby, ice hockey and others.”The research paper, “Applying the Bradford Hill Criteria for Causation to Repetitive Head Impacts and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy”, has been published in Frontiers in Neurology and it is hoped it can force global sporting organisations such as Fifa and World Rugby into acknowledging there is a causal link between CTE and repetitive head impacts.This month the Football Association announced it would start a trial to remove heading until the age of 12.In rugby, there has been a number of players showing signs of early-onset dementia and on Monday the lobby group Progressive Rugby said it was finalising a comprehensive list of welfare requirements it would submit to governing bodies such as World Rugby and the Rugby Football Union.On Tuesday morning Strada will front a media conference close to Bedminster, owned by the former US president Donald Trump. There, 9/11 Families United will publicise documents they believe prove Saudi involvement in the attacks on the World Trade Center. Saudi Arabia has always categorically denied being complicit in 9/11. “The players need to see this and the White House needs to pay attention as well,” said Strada, whose husband Tom was among the almost 3,000 people killed in the 2001 atrocity.New Jersey lost 750 residents in 9/11. Strada said of golfers including Phil Mickelson who have converted to the LIV Series: “They might have all thought about what it would feel like for the families if they came to Bedminster and New Jersey. Of all the courses in the world, this is literally the worst they could hold a tournament in. It was extremely insulting and hurtful to think that, six weeks prior to the latest anniversary, families were not going to feel the pain of a Saudi‑backed league in their back yard.“The families suffered the most but these towns suffered, too. There were schools with broken-hearted children coming back into classrooms. New York City cannot host a tournament so Bedminster, New Jersey is the worst place on the planet this could be taking place.”Trump’s involvement as essentially the tournament host adds another layer of controversy. Last week he actively advised golfers to side with LIV against the traditional model of the PGA Tour. “He should know better than anyone, as a former president, the level of depravity the kingdom is capable of,” Strada said. “He turned a blind eye to it when he was president. He is a New Yorker, he claims to have empathy for the families but clearly he does not. If he had a sensitive bone in his body he would understand the level of angst this causes.“These people don’t understand how devastating September 11 was. My husband was dismembered. We don’t know where all his body parts landed. He has never been identified. There was a psychological cruelness that people do not realise. These players have flippantly forgotten how awful the attacks were but former president Trump is especially egregious in his behaviour towards us. There are no words for it.”Strada branded Graeme McDowell’s public statement of a “smear campaign” against LIV as “comical”.On behalf of a body which represents more than 10,000 family members of victims and survivors of 9/11, Strada wrote a scathing letter to the representatives of Mickelson and a handful of others after they pledged commitment to LIV. No response has been forthcoming, although Mickelson has expressed his “deepest sympathy” to the families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11.“That didn’t surprise me,” Strada said on the lack of a direct response to the letter. “It was disappointing. I don’t think they know how to react to the families. They are just spinning off Saudi talking points, right and left. They are becoming more and more insulting as time goes by because they just repeat the same things. Sportswashing is a very serious issue if you look at it through a serious lens.“I cannot imagine that they are completely heartless but actions speak louder than words and their actions scream that they are heartless. They have done some abhorrent things; the shirt [worn by Pat Perez] with 100 dollar bill design. The dancing and partying on the LIV jet. How did they think 9/11 families would feel about that?”A routine defence by LIV golfers that the source of money for golf tournaments under the banner of existing tours receives little focus cuts no ice with Strada. “Business is one thing,” she said. “I might not like people doing business with the kingdom but that’s not what this is. It is not a business arrangement. This is intentional sportswashing to cleanse their image, manipulate public opinion and sweep the 9/11 atrocities under the rug. Golfers are willing to do this because of a large sum of money.”In response to previous outrage from those affected by 9/11 to the staging of an LIV event at Bedminster, organisers said, “These families have our deepest sympathy,” adding: “While some may not agree, we believe golf is a force for good around the world.”The city of Chicago has thrown its considerable weight this week behind an attempt to keep the Bears at Soldier Field, the NFL team’s base since 1971. The historic stadium, the oldest in the NFL, may very well be in its finals days as the Bears’ home.Last fall, the team’s ownership reached a purchase agreement on a sprawling 326-acre site in the Chicago suburbs. The Bears’ purchase is essentially pending although before it becomes final, there are a litany of logistical, financial, and legal loops both sides will need to shore up.If the purchase is indeed finalized, Bears fans will be in for a massive change. While fans can rely on their team’s quarterback struggles continuing until the end of time, switching homes from a relic steeped in NFL history to a modern facility far from the city’s heart will be an emotional adjustment.For Chicago residents, it presents logistical challenges as well. The Bears’ proposed new home is 30 miles from Soldier Field in Arlington Heights, near O’Hare airport. It may only be 26 miles from downtown, but as anyone who has braved the perennially clogged I-90 can attest, the ride is often over an hour. But, perhaps crucially, the new location presents a goldmine of financial opportunity for Bears ownership, who do not own the area around Soldier Field.Every statement from the Bears reiterates their intention to purchase Arlington Park, but the city of Chicago isn’t giving up without a fight. The city’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, is determined to keep the Bears playing at Soldier Field beyond 2033, when their lease expires (the team could break their lease early if they pay the city an $84m release clause).This week Lightfoot unveiled three proposals to improve Soldier Field, focused on giving the stadium the option to be domed for year-round use – a useful feature amid Chicago’s brutal winters and sweltering summers. The plans also include revitalizing the surrounding area and adding “floating pavilions” to enhance parking options at a stadium that can be tough to reach by car. The organization may also be allowed to earn revenue from a naming rights deal.“Not surprisingly, we are doing what we believe is making a compelling case for the Chicago Bears to stay in Chicago. They want a tier-one stadium environment to maximize revenues, and we agree that we are going to keep making the case to the Bears, the NFL and public that a revitalized Soldier Field makes the most economic sense for that storied franchise,” Lightfoot said.But Lightfoot’s efforts appear to be nothing more than a very desperate Hail Mary. Simply put, Soldier Field has little to offer in the modern NFL, where streams of revenue are considered, by many owners, more of a measure of success than wins and losses. With a capacity of 61,500, Soldier Field is the smallest stadium in the league – so small, in fact, that it’s not eligible to host major events like the World Cup or Super Bowl (Lightfoot’s plans could increase capacity to 70,000). It also received a $600m botched facelift in 2003, which led to the Chicago Tribune’s architecture critic dubbing the stadium “The Eyesore On The Lake Shore”. Taxpayers’ appetite for funding further renovations – Lightfoot’s plans would cost anywhere between $900m and $2.2bn – may also be understandably questionable as the cost of living skyrockets and the threat of recession looms. The mayor did not say who would fund the plans, but selling naming rights for the stadium is one possibility.Despite Lightfoot’s public fight, the Bears continue to move forward with their plans to ditch Soldier Field for Arlington Heights. In March, the Bears hired an architecture firm to help design the potential new stadium. On Monday, they rereleased a statement they had put our earlier this month expressing their determination to move.“The only potential project the Chicago Bears are exploring for a new stadium development is Arlington Park,” the Bears said. “As part of our mutual agreement with the seller of that property, we are not pursuing alternative stadium deals or sites, including renovations to Soldier Field, while we are under contract. We have informed the city of Chicago that we intend to honor our contractual commitments as we continue our due diligence and predevelopment activities on the Arlington Heights property.”There is no guarantee that the Arlington Heights purchase will result in a new stadium but that is the likeliest outcome. The McCaskey Halas family, the owners of the Bears, aren’t exactly known for their deep pockets, so a full privately funded stadium a la Stan Kroenke’s SoFi kingdom in Los Angeles seems unlikely. However, if the residents of Arlington Heights help the Bears join the ranks of NFL teams that have incorporated some semblance of public funding (only SoFi, Gillette Stadium, and MetLife Stadium are privately funded), the McCaskeys will be teeming with options for the land they own around the stadium. From naming rights to concerts to major international sporting events to luxurious stadium amenities with equally luxurious price tags to hotels and anything else they care to add to their megaplex, the possibilities are endless.By exiting Chicago, the Bears would leave a massive void in the town’s vibrant sports scene. But that’s the story of the today’s NFL where last year’s revenue topped $11bn and is tracking to reach $25bn by 2027. The city of Chicago doesn’t stand a chance.\\n\\n        \\n            Mon 25 Jul 2022 11.10\\xa0BST\\n\\n\\n            Last modified on Mon 25 Jul 2022 12.10\\xa0BST\\n\\nPhotograph: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Ashley Landis/APPhotograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Steph Chambers/Getty ImagesPhotograph: AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Patrick Smith/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesPhotograph: Martin Rickett/PA\"),\n",

       "  'Russia will pull out of the International Space Station (ISS) after 2024 and focus on building its own orbiting outpost, the country’s space chief has said, in a move that will end a symbolic two-decade orbital partnership between Moscow and the west.Yuri Borisov, the newly appointed head of the space agency Roscosmos, said during a meeting with Vladimir Putin that Russia would fulfil its obligations to its partners on the ISS before leaving the project.“The decision to leave the station after 2024 has been made,” Borisov said, to which Putin responded: “Good.”Borisov’s statement reaffirmed previous declarations made by the previous Roscosmos head, Dmitry Rogozin, about Moscow’s intention to leave the station after 2024. The outspoken Rogozin had threatened to end the partnership unless the US, EU and Canada lifted their sanctions against enterprises involved in the Russian space industry.The first version of the ISS was launched in 1998, and astronauts from a range of western countries and Russia have continuously lived there since 2002, the longest constant human presence in low Earth orbit in history. The station was widely seen as a symbol of the post-cold war partnership between the two space superpowers, Russia and the US. Speaking in 2001 alongside the then US president, George W Bush, Putin lauded the ISS as an example of “very successful” bilateral ties between the two countries.Soon after Borisov’s meeting with Putin, Roscosmos released an image on its social media channels of what it said was a blueprint for its own orbiting outpost. The blueprint said the space station would accommodate two Russian astronauts at first, eventually expanding to four.A senior Nasa official told Reuters on Tuesday that Russia has not communicated its intent to withdraw from the ISS.Despite widespread condemnation of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, space had remained one of the last avenues for cooperation between Moscow and the west.Nasa and Roscosmos made a deal this month for astronauts to continue riding Russian rockets and for Russian cosmonauts to catch lifts to the ISS with the private US rocket company SpaceX beginning in the autumn.The agreement ensured the ISS would always have at least one American and one Russian onboard to keep both sides of the outpost running smoothly, Nasa and Russian officials said.Still, Borisov’s latest announcement to leave the ISS will not come as a surprise given Moscow’s growing isolation. Russia’s space agency caused controversy this month when it released images of its cosmonauts onboard the ISS celebrating Moscow’s capture of the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk.')]"
